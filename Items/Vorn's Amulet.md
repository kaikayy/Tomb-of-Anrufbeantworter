_Wondrous Item, rare_

Every shield guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the shield guardian is [[incapacitated]] until a replacement amulet is created.

A [[Vorn]]’s amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn’t being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.

A [[Vorn]]’s solitary focus is to follow the amulet’s wearer. As an action the amulet’s wearer can command the guardian to open up and allow a creature to enter. If the wearer enters [[Vorn]], he will be able to control the shield guardian and is protected from all damage but will be unable to take actions themselves. If [[Vorn]] is reduced to 0 hp, any creature inside him will be pushed out onto an empty space within 5ft of [[Vorn]].  
  
If a creature that isn't the wearer enters [[Vorn]], they take **8d6** piercing damage once [[Vorn]] reactivates as mutiple mechanical part are pushed into their body.
