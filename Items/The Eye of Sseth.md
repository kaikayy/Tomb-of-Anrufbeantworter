Wondrous item, artifact

A large red gem containing the consciousnesses of many [[Yuan-ti]] and some other intelligent creatures. Their voices swirl inside anyone's mind as soon as they touch it, revealing to them some of the eye's powers. As an action the eye of [[Sseth]] can be placed in an unoccupied space next to you, where it will then hover 2 feet of the ground, you may then choose to expend charges of the eye to activate one of its abilities. Any creature that touches the eye may use their action to stop one of its abilities or to expend charges to activate more abilities, as long as the eye has the charges required. Once placed the eye can only be moved once all of its abilities are deactivated again.  
  
**Absorbtion (0 charges):  
**All creatures, except the user, in a 20ft. radius around the eye must succeed on a Dc 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled towards the eye as close as possible. any creature (including the user) touching the eye take **4d6** necrotic damage as their blood and flesh is ripped from their bones and absorbed by the eye. The eye regains 1 charge per creature that was killed by this ability with an intelligent score of 5 or higher and has blood and flesh. The eye can hold a maximum of 10 charges.
