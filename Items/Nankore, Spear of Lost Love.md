Weapon (spear), uncommon (requires attunement)

The spear of the omuan champion [[Thiru-taya]]. His last wish, before he died, was to protect the one he loved most and tell her that he loved her. This spear was infused with that wish.  
  
While attuned to this weapon you can the following benefits:  
  
You have a **+1** bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
  
**Protect the one you love**
When you are reduced to 50% of your maximum hit points (rounded down and ignoring temporary changes to hp) or fewer and the spear is within 60ft of the attuned creature, the spear will fly to you and hower near you. While in this state it gains the following properties until you die:
-   Attacks with this spear deal force damage and have a reach of 15ft.
-   Once per turn, when a creature within 15 feet of you damages you, the spear unerringly hits the attacker, dealing **1d8 + 6**! force damage to it.

**Last Words**
As an action you can expend one charge to cast the speak with dead spell. Nankore regains its charge when the creature attuned to it dies.
