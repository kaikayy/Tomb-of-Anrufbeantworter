# Last Session: 76

Recap - Talsen

Talsen finds garbage piles as nests which the Firenewts use as sleeping accommodations
Musharib tells us the rooms ahead were storage rooms and the Gauntlet of Moradin should be over the bridge where the Pig was

Shadow takes a look in the other trashed rooms
- Finds a few barrels that are still intact with dice on top
- The Firenewts used them as sleeping quarters
- Goes through the corridor
	- Perception: 19
		- Hears the grunting of the Pig
		- Hears the clashing of metal from the other side of the lava river

Delwyn tries to leave for the Pig
- Kadrin advises against it

Talsen levies to push on to look for more survivors
- Kadrin agrees and heals Talsen for 5 HP
	- heals himself for 4 HP

We go to get the Unconscious Albino Dwarf (Foznem Axeshaper) from the main chamber to leave him in the area we were before with Shago and then push on for survivors
- We go back through the metal smithing and armory rooms
- Talsen takes a look at the armor
	- Well made armor for Dwarfs, Half Plate Armor, a bit scratched
	- There also seems to be a lot of weapons here
		- `This chamber includes six each of battleaxes, greataxes, mauls, morningstars, war picks, warhammers, and heavy crossbows, plus two hundred crossbow bolts and four suits of dwarven half-plate armor.`

We go towards the Pig, being led by Musharib through the complex
- Kadrin casts Armor of Agathys on himself
- Talsen drinks a Potion of Healing, 7 HP
- The Pig starts squeaking and runs onto the bridge
	- Kadrin uses Divine Sense
		- The Pig smells of Sulphur
- Kadrin casts Eldritch Blast on the Pig
	- 16 to hit, 7 Force DMG
		- It poofs away
- We arrive at the metal bridge and see a pulled-down lever
- We cross the bridge without a problem
- We see an adamantine branded Iron double Door in front of us, it seems to be flanked by two suits of armor that have seen better days
	- `Two suits of dwarven half plate armor stand on either side of an adamantine-banded iron door. These suits of armor were beautiful once, but now theyâ€™re scarred by weapons, scorched by fire, and smeared with filth. The door has two locks, one above the other.`
	- The door seems to have two locks
	- Musharib tells us that this is the Vault and that it needs keys the former forge master possessed before he died in the attack
	- We hear clattering behind us and the bridge retracts from the other side
		- We see a young female person, lever in hand on the other side of the bridge
		- We see Fake Kordelia, Kadrin's Sister
		- ### Fight_S76

The Fight ends, Kadrin collapses as Shadow catches him and carries him away
- We group up again
- Talsen applies the last Restorative Ointment to Kadrin
	- 11 HP
	- goes back into the room and collects Fake Kordelia's blood
- Musharib explains that the door we where at, requires two keys but if the lower lock is attempted with the wrong key, the bridge retracts
- We discuss if we keep looking for survivors or take a rest
	- We decide to take a rest
- Talsen writes "Smeltery" on a piece of Paper and sticks it to the end of the minecart track
	- For when Musharib's reinforcements arrive

##### SHORT REST (Start)
- Kadrin commends Shadow on her Healing abilities
- Kadrin looks at Nankore, Spear of Lost Love
	- Talsen explains that it might have something for Kadrin when Talsen's gone
- Many Albino Dwarfs lead by a female dwarf called Sithi Vinecutter
- Musharib and Sithi Vinecutter argue over him running away
	- asks where his companions are and for them to better not be Firenewt's
		- Talsen tries to make a hissing noise
			- Performance: 19
		- Sithi Vinecutter throws a Light Hammer at Talsen
			- 12 to hit, miss
			- Talsen pockets the Light Hammer
- Kadrin drops the Illusion around us
- Sithi Vinecutter wants to scour the other rooms
	- The party makes clear that that would be foolish without them
	- They "parked" a new guardian at the door, Ebonfang
	- They are mostly workers but an "impromptu militia" in the current circumstance
- Talsen asks who of them are the best smiths
	- Sithi Vinecutter was going to be a new forge master
	- Talsen asks Sithi Vinecutter if she could reforge the two damaged armor pieces
		- It is possible, they will talk about it later
- Sithi Vinecutter asks where the keys to the door went and asks Talsen to look through the rubble in the adjacent room with her
	- He finds a box in a corner, made of iron, looks like a book
		- "Beginnings" and "Endings" is written on the sides of the box
		- In both compartments is the mold for a key
	- Talsen tells her that he jumped the bridge before
		- Sithi Vinecutter says that that is impressive
