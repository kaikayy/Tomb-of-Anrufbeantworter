We arrive at Nangnang's Shrine
- `Monoliths adorned with prancing, frog-like figures rise from the swamp. Beyond, a ruined edifice shaped like an arrowhead squats in the muddy water. Bushes and trees grow from its roof. At the pointed front of the building, steps ascend to a stone door caked in slime.`
- We see some Grung guarding the Shrine
- Shadow, Nature: 20
