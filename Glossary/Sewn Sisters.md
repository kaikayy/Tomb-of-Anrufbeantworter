Part of a Chultan Fairy tail
3 "Ladies"

1. [[Widow Groat]]
has tarnished gold coins covering her eyes and ants nesting in her skull. The ants serve as her spies, and their presence often portends her arrival.
2. [[Peggy Deadbells]]
wears a string of chattering childrenâ€™s teeth and thumps about on a heavy peg leg. When she laughs, yellow gas billows out of her nose and ears.
3. [[Baggy Nanna]]
has a squirming leather sack sewn over her head. The bag also contains a cockerel, a viper, and a terrier.

The story almost always ends in tragedy, if you go too far out into the forest, one of the Hags steals your Soul.
