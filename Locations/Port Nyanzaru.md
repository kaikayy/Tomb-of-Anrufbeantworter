- Location and Capital of [[Chult]]

Until recently, Port Nyanzaru was under the firm control of [[Amn]], a foreign nation. Nine years ago, [[Amn]] was forced to relinquish the city to a wealthy and powerful consortium of Chultan traders backed by the [[Ytepka Society]] (pronounced yeh-TEP-kah), or risk a bloody conflict that probably would have ended with the city winning its independence anyway. Seven Chultan traders have since grown into influential merchant princes ([[Trade Princes]]), enticing folk from up and down the region with their wares.
