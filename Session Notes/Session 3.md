[[Gannin|Gannin]] sets up the Raincatcher and we all fill our Waterskins after cooking the water

I tie up the Raincatcher to safe the Water

[[Kairi]] hears a deep, booming voice in her head, it's the message from [[Zitembe]]( brought by the Harbormaster): Junglecity to the south sorounded by mountains, there is a black obilisk and an ominous presence. [[Zitembe]] is vouching for us, If we return [[Inete]] safely, he will nullify out dept with the [[Ytepka Society]].

“a jungle city far to the south, enclosed by cliffs and crawling with snakes”

“a black obelisk draped in vines.”

I carry [[Kairi]] on my shoulders after she asked. [[Kairi]] asks about my Tattoos.

[[Shadow]] notices a familier family of bush, a [[Menga]] Bush - the leaves can be dried and mangled up, make a tea with slightly healing properties - too much consumption leads to Unconsciousness for 1h

[[Gannin|Gannin]] smells the leaves, [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] bites one CON SAV.: 12 - feels a little dizzy

[[Gannin|Gannin]] slaps Kadrins face, 14 to hit, hits, [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] is fine again.

Shadows bow is at the ready and [[Kairi]] carries the Firewood. [[Undril Silvertusk|Undril]] sets up the Fire.

Nature Check: G 17 [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] [[Nat.1]] (0) - to see if we know what the creature is

[[Gannin|Gannin]] looks for the creature, Perc: 10 - [[Gannin|Gannin]] sees nothing in the bushes

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] touches the Cooking Pot, DEX SAV: 12 - lets it glow bright pink
