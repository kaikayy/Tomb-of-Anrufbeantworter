Perc.: 18
Reads her Book, INT: 10
Coughs up a bit of Yellow Smoke
Wakes up [[Kadrin]], he looks out of the Window, there is no smoke
[[Kadrin]] says he can't really do much
[[Shadow]] says that it wasn't a lot, coughs again and nothing comes out anymore
[[Shadow]] tells [[Kadrin]] to go back to sleep and stands atop the table
_Talsens Dream:
Piercing Headache with ringing ears, thousands of voices around him, standing back in the blood and in the cave.
Looking around the voices surround him closely as [[Yuan-Ti]] demanding various things from him.
Perception: 2 - Doesn't find [[Ssaztehsi]], the one he talked to before
Calls out if this is [[The Hissing]] he was talking about.
They talk about destroying [[The Hissing]] and not sealing it away, they want to give [[Talsen]] power to defeat it.
Perception: Nat.20 (19) - A sound pierces through the voices, the clanging of metal, a faint light shines through the Bloodpool and a flaming sword clangs against other Swords. A [[Yuan-Ti]] wielding a great burning sword.
[[Talsen]] runs towards this one, STR: Nat.20 (24)
Barges through many different kinds of [[Yuan-Ti]], sees an Elf standing just there, doing nothing. Asks him what this is and what he's doing here.
Persuasion: 13 - The Elf just stares blankly and doesn't answer
[[Talsen]] arrives at the Fight and sees [[Ssaztehsi]] fighting other [[Yuan-Ti]]
[[Talsen]] asks [[Ssaztehsi]] what is going on?
He says that they have a disagreement and they want [[Talsen]] not to seal away [[The Eye of Sseth]] but use it's power.
Insight: Nat.1 (0) - Seems truthful enough for fighting a bunch of things
[[Talsen]] throws the Spear at a [[Yuan-Ti]], ignites it 5 DMG, 12 to hit, the [[Yuan-Ti]] melts into the pool of blood.
Picks up the Spear and attacks another one, 26 to hit, another one melts
After one melts, another comes up from the ranks of the Voices and replaces it.
[[Ssaztehsi]] says that [[Talsen]] has to seal [[The Hissing]] back into the Vault in [[Hisari]] by getting it into the Chamber and placing [[The Eye of Sseth]] on the Pedestal.
A Vision of [[Yuan-Ti]] carrying the Body of what seems like an unconscious Beholder perform a ritual, lead by [[Ssaztehsi]], they revive it and start eating the creature, it develops scales and snake like tendrils, an ear piercing scream changes to a hissing of like a million snakes. Something failed and the [[Yuan-Ti]] take a step back. Out of the Pit they threw the creature in, something rises, something Made of Snakes, nearly see-through. They do no damage to it and try to flee. Outside, to [[Hisari]], pristine Buildings adorned with snake insignia, it crumbles, [[Yuan-Ti]] fall dead just by sound, the whole Temple collapses and the ground with it.
[[Talsen]] is back in the blood pit and plunges his head in the blood calling out anyone there as crazy, he says not to play with gods, [[Ssaztehsi]] says that it was a failed attempt to create an avatar of their god.
A Wave of Blood rushes over [[Talsen]] and he wakes up._
