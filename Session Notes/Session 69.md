Recap - [[Kadrin]]

[[Talsen]] asks if we can get a bit of distance to talk amongst ourselves about this question
- We cannot as leaving this rooms means leaving this place entirely
- We discuss here
	- We cannot imprison [[Ras Nsi]] with [[Dendar the Night Serpent]]
		- [[Saja N’baza]] seems annoyed but says it might be possible to imprison [[Ras Nsi]], but she doesn't want to do that
	- The undead wouldn't go away if we kill him but they would be no longer chained to his will
	- His raising of undead has decreased but he has taken lead of the [[Yuan-Ti]] and cause more evil
	- Two things need to happen for the [[City of Mezro]] to return. 
	1. The Death of [[Ras Nsi]]
	2. The [[Bara]]e of the City must deem that [[Chult]] is in no further danger
- It seems like we all want [[Ras Nsi]] gone but find it hard to image what would happen if the [[City of Mezro]] would come back
- We agree to kill [[Ras Nsi]]
- [[Saja N’baza]] assures us that [[Chult]] has never seen much inter-city conflict aside from [[Omu]]
	- She bestows a boon upon us and declares us "Heroes of [[Chult]]"
