Recap - [[Kadrin]]

![[69.png]]

[[Talsen]] asks if we can get a bit of distance to talk amongst ourselves about this question
- We cannot as leaving this rooms means leaving this place entirely
- We discuss here
	- We cannot imprison [[Ras Nsi]] with [[Dendar the Night Serpent]]
		- [[Saja N’baza]] seems annoyed but says it might be possible to imprison [[Ras Nsi]], but she doesn't want to do that
	- The undead wouldn't go away if we kill him but they would be no longer chained to his will
	- His raising of undead has decreased but he has taken lead of the [[Yuan-Ti]] and cause more evil
	- Two things need to happen for the [[City of Mezro]] to return. 
	1. The Death of [[Ras Nsi]]
	2. The [[Bara]]e of the City must deem that [[Chult]] is in no further danger
- It seems like we all want [[Ras Nsi]] gone but find it hard to image what would happen if the [[City of Mezro]] would come back
- We agree to kill [[Ras Nsi]]
- [[Saja N’baza]] assures us that [[Chult]] has never seen much inter-city conflict aside from [[Omu]]
	- She bestows a boon upon us and declares us "Heroes of [[Chult]]"

Weather: Light Ash Fall
The Snakes are gone and the stairwell is free, behind us is an empty room overgrown with moss.
We look down and see our companions where we left them with a burned out campfire. [[Shago]] is digging graves for us.
We move down the Ziggurat, no challenges oppose us on our way down.
[[Shago]] is glad we're alive and hugs us, [[Musharib]] asks what we found out, [[Stomps]] is hungry.

[[Kadrin]] cooks, Rations

We discuss where we want to go while we eat
- [[Musharib]] mentions [[Hrakhamar]] and points out where it is on the Map
	- We all decide to keep our promise and go towards [[Hrakhamar]]
	- [[Musharib]] talks about a Dragon ([[Tzindelor]]) sitting in the Adamantine Mine and the [[Firenewt]] taking over the forge
		- They made the [[Wyrmheart Mine]] where they found an Adamantine vein
		- The main focus is getting back the [[Gauntlet of Moradin]]
		- It's not known where it is. It's last known location is inside the vault of the forge.
