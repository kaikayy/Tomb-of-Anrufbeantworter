	- Ka: Why did you never return or said anything about it?
	- Ko: You can blame Dad for that, the small village life wasn't for me

	- Ka: How did you survive?
	- Ko: I'm pretty good with a sword, I've survived so far
	- Ka: I've searched for you for so long, I don't want you to be in danger anymore.
	- Ko: I'm not really in danger or something here, the [[Yuan-Ti]] are no match. we can just fall back if we are to get overwhelmed, we're quite fast
	- Ka: I guess I can't tell you what to do. Where would you go if you'd leave [[Chult]] right now?
	- Ko: I don't know. I was planning to hang out in the [[City of Mezro]] with [[Artus Cimber]] some more, maybe stay there.
	- Ko: [[Artus Cimber]] got the [[Ring of Winter]] from the [[Frost Giants]] as a mission from the [[Harpers]], then the [[City of Mezro]] disappeared while he was away. It stops you from aging but it also seems to be quite evil.

[[Eku]] greets us as we are waking up to show us the purification chamber.
- We follow her to the chamber
- _A Large round Maze pattern covers the ground of this old, moss covered Chamber. Its pathways seem to change whenever it leaves your direct focus, causing you to feel a bit dizzy. Set into the center of the maze ist a Large flat yellow crystal that radiates a comforting warm light. Facing you on the edge of the maze and on the other side of the maze lie the only two entrances to the maze pattern and before the one facing you lies a comfortable looking blanket._
- [[Eku]] explains the Maze as follows
	- It can help you find a path in your life
	- You do not have to find an exit in this maze, just a path
	- Just sit on the blanket in front of you and meditate
	- there seems to be a pathway for all of us
		- There is more of a discovery of a new path for [[Shadow]] and [[Talsen]]
	- if a person is not willing to be purified, the maze leads them onto a different path

[[Delwyn]] goes ahead and sits on the blanket to meditate
- _You find yourself surrounded by stone walls in all directions but one. The 15ft. high walls look old and weathered like the buildings all around Omu. Above you you see a Gigantic Stone Ceiling in the sky as if you had been shrunk to the size of an ant. The path before you is paved with dirt._
- follows the path
- __
- goes left toward his mother
- _The room around you begins to change into the scene of a dirty back alley of Baldur's Gate. Dark clouds hang over the city and heavy rain pours down from the rooftops. In the shadows of the alley, you spot the crouched down figure of a young woman. Her clothes are rags and her one boot is barely holding together. She looks malnourished and has multiple wounds all across her body. As she sits there shivering and alone, she begins to speak a prayer under her breath: "If there is any god out there, willing to hear my plea, I would give anything to end my suffering. My life, my first born, my soul, anything!" Shortly after she finishes her prayer, the shadows around her begin to shift in an unnatural way. They begin to flow into her wounds, healing them in the process, while others flow to her right and and form into the shape of a familiar looking knife. the knife begins to spin in the palm of her hand until it stops to point out of the alley way as if to guide the woman. She in turn begins to walk and as she leaves the alley, you are back in the maze with only one way to go._
- goes ahead
- __
- goes toward his mother
- _The world once again changes around you. You see the young woman walk the streets, guided by the dark knife in her hand. She arrives at a fancy looking Carriage, standing still in one of the more dangerous parts of Baldur's gate. The Carriage driver lies dead on the pavement while two thugs are looking through his pockets. A third man throws open the door to the carriage, a readied short sword in hand. You hear the voice of your father call out from the carriage: "Do you have any idea who you are dealing with?". But before the bandit can answer, the young woman had already darted behind him, plunging the shadowy knife into his back. The other two are dealt with just as quick with the precision of a master assassin. As the three men lie bleeding out in the street. Your father pocks his head out of the carriage with a surprised expression on his face: "What is your name?" "Sylvie"
As the two look at each other in this rainy street, you are back at the maze._
- goes ahead
- __
- "What truth?"
- Perception: 14
- The voice says "The truth of her death."
- turns to the ominous voice
- _The walls shift to show a familiar looking room. You see the banquet hall of your father's mansion. In the Room with you are your father, mutiple servants and your mother who looks just as pale as she did before she died from sickness. Your parents are eating dinner until suddenly, your mother drops her cutlery and begins to cough. She falls to the floor, but neither your father nor his servants even attempt to help her. Eventually the coughing stops and your mother lays lifeless on the floor.
Your father calmly wipes his mouth with a napkin and begins to speak: "Finally. Prepare the funeral, tell everyone that my 'dear' wife has died due to illness. Once the funeral is over throw that boy Delvyn to the streets. I was hoping that with Sylvie's connection to Shar, he would have developed some kind of special magical powers, but he has been nothing but a disappointment. Once you are done with that, give the same treatment to the rest of my family. I have no more need for them to appeal to the other noble families." an undead severed hand, holding an eyeball begins to crawl onto the table. Your father looks to it: "Withers, My followers and I will soon depart for Chult to witness the beginning of the end of this wretched world. Prepare for our arrival." The hands palm turns to your father, revealing a mouth that begins to speak: "As you wish master Dawnsong, the devourer bring an end to all life!" The illusion of your former home fades and you find yourself standing in the center of the maze._
- "Why do you have a connection to Shar? What happened to you? What else do I not know?"
- S: "I was an orphan, abused and beaten everyday. I see the weight of my words now."
- "What does Dad have to do with this?"
- S: "I did not know you Father was the one who killed me. I did not know what else he was doing but I heard rumors of a cult but I didn't take it serious and left it alone."
- "I can't just leave you"
- To Shar: "What will happen to her?"
- Shar: "These souls usually fade away after a while and are lost forever."
- "Is there a way to safe her?"
- Shar: "Perhaps. If you can bolster your powers and delve deeper into the Shadowfell you might be able to strengthen her soul. Of course you couldn't reconstruct her completely."
- "What happens if I site with you?"
- Shar: "You will become stronger than ever before. But I want you to destroy the Soulmongerer."
- To Sylvie: "Do you think I can trust her?"
- S: "You cannot trust her. I unknowingly sold your soul to her when I made my pact."
- To Shar: "Is this true?"
- Shar: "Your Mother had a price to pay, for the life I have given her. And now it is time that she pays her debt."
- "Is there any way, I can trust you?"
- Shar: "I am a goddess. I hold my word."
- "That doesn't mean much to me"
- Shar: "Even if this goddess is in pose"
