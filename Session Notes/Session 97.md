Recap - [[Kadrin]]

We make camp
- [[Talsen]] hangs up his Ogre Pelt to dry
	- gives [[Delwyn]] the Red Wizards Spellbook

	- she accepts
	- Ka: Where did you go after you left back then?
	- Ko: Traveled around the Sword Coast to see the big cities
	- Did Mercenary work
	- later met [[Artus Cimber]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]
	- snuck onto his boat while he was leaving for [[Chult]]
	- followed him around since then
	- Ka: Why did you never return or said anything about it?
	- Ko: You can blame Dad for that, the small village life wasn't for me
	- Ka: We could've done this together
	- Ko: Yeah, I didn't know if you were ready yet
	- Ka: Still don't feel ready
	- Ko: You look pretty ready to me
	- Ka: How did you survive?
	- Ko: I'm pretty good with a sword, I've survived so far
	- Ka: I've searched for you for so long, I don't want you to be in danger anymore.
	- Ko: I'm not really in danger or something here, the [[Yuan-Ti]] are no match. we can just fall back if we are to get overwhelmed, we're quite fast
	- Ka: I guess I can't tell you what to do. Where would you go if you'd leave [[Chult]] right now?
	- Ko: I don't know. I was planning to hang out in the [[City of Mezro]] with [[Artus Cimber]] some more, maybe stay there.
	- Ko: [[Artus Cimber]] got the [[Ring of Winter]] from the [[Frost Giants]] as a mission from the [[Harpers]], then the [[City of Mezro]] disappeared while he was away. It stops you from aging but it also seems to be quite evil.
		- It can't be destroyed by any normal means but has to be put on the hand of some summer queen in the Fey Realm

[[Eku]] greets us as we are waking up to show us the purification chamber.
- We follow her to the chamber
- _A Large round Maze pattern covers the ground of this old, moss covered Chamber. Its pathways seem to change whenever it leaves your direct focus, causing you to feel a bit dizzy. Set into the center of the maze ist a Large flat yellow crystal that radiates a comforting warm light. Facing you on the edge of the maze and on the other side of the maze lie the only two entrances to the maze pattern and before the one facing you lies a comfortable looking blanket._
- [[Eku]] explains the Maze as follows
	- It can help you find a path in your life
	- You do not have to find an exit in this maze, just a path
	- Just sit on the blanket in front of you and meditate
	- there seems to be a pathway for all of us
		- There is more of a discovery of a new path for [[Shadow]] and [[Talsen]]
	- if a person is not willing to be purified, the maze leads them onto a different path

[[Delwyn]] goes ahead and sits on the blanket to meditate
- _You find yourself surrounded by stone walls in all directions but one. The 15ft. high walls look old and weathered like the buildings all around Omu. Above you you see a Gigantic Stone Ceiling in the sky as if you had been shrunk to the size of an ant. The path before you is paved with dirt._
- follows the path
- __
- goes left toward his mother
- _The room around you begins to change into the scene of a dirty back alley of Baldur's Gate. Dark clouds hang over the city and heavy rain pours down from the rooftops. In the shadows of the alley, you spot the crouched down figure of a young woman. Her clothes are rags and her one boot is barely holding together. She looks malnourished and has multiple wounds all across her body. As she sits there shivering and alone, she begins to speak a prayer under her breath: "If there is any god out there, willing to hear my plea, I would give anything to end my suffering. My life, my first born, my soul, anything!" Shortly after she finishes her prayer, the shadows around her begin to shift in an unnatural way. They begin to flow into her wounds, healing them in the process, while others flow to her right and and form into the shape of a familiar looking knife. the knife begins to spin in the palm of her hand until it stops to point out of the alley way as if to guide the woman. She in turn begins to walk and as she leaves the alley, you are back in the maze with only one way to go._
- goes ahead
- __
- goes toward his mother
- _The world once again changes around you. You see the young woman walk the streets, guided by the dark knife in her hand. She arrives at a fancy looking Carriage, standing still in one of the more dangerous parts of Baldur's gate. The Carriage driver lies dead on the pavement while two thugs are looking through his pockets. A third man throws open the door to the carriage, a readied short sword in hand. You hear the voice of your father call out from the carriage: "Do you have any idea who you are dealing with?". But before the bandit can answer, the young woman had already darted behind him, plunging the shadowy knife into his back. The other two are dealt with just as quick with the precision of a master assassin. As the three men lie bleeding out in the street. Your father pocks his head out of the carriage with a surprised expression on his face: "What is your name?" "Sylvie"
As the two look at each other in this rainy street, you are back at the maze._
- goes ahead
- __
- "What truth?"
- Perception: 14
- The voice says "The truth of her death."
- turns to the ominous voice
- _The walls shift to show a familiar looking room. You see the banquet hall of your father's mansion. In the Room with you are your father, multiple servants and your mother who looks just as pale as she did before she died from sickness. Your parents are eating dinner until suddenly, your mother drops her cutlery and begins to cough. She falls to the floor, but neither your father nor his servants even attempt to help her. Eventually the coughing stops and your mother lays lifeless on the floor.
Your father calmly wipes his mouth with a napkin and begins to speak: "Finally. Prepare the funeral, tell everyone that my 'dear' wife has died due to illness. Once the funeral is over throw that boy Delwyn to the streets. I was hoping that with Sylvie's connection to Shar, he would have developed some kind of special magical powers, but he has been nothing but a disappointment. Once you are done with that, give the same treatment to the rest of my family. I have no more need for them to appeal to the other noble families." an undead severed hand, holding an eyeball begins to crawl onto the table. Your father looks to it: "Withers, My followers and I will soon depart for Chult to witness the beginning of the end of this wretched world. Prepare for our arrival." The hands palm turns to your father, revealing a mouth that begins to speak: "As you wish master Dawnsong, the devourer bring an end to all life!" The illusion of your former home fades and you find yourself standing in the center of the maze._
- "Why do you have a connection to Shar? What happened to you? What else do I not know?"
- S: "I was an orphan, abused and beaten everyday. I see the weight of my words now."
- "What does Dad have to do with this?"
- S: "I did not know you Father was the one who killed me. I did not know what else he was doing but I heard rumors of a cult but I didn't take it serious and left it alone."
- "I can't just leave you"
- To Shar: "What will happen to her?"
- Shar: "These souls usually fade away after a while and are lost forever."
- "Is there a way to safe her?"
- Shar: "Perhaps. If you can bolster your powers and delve deeper into the Shadowfell you might be able to strengthen her soul. Of course you couldn't reconstruct her completely."
- "What happens if I site with you?"
- Shar: "You will become stronger than ever before. But I want you to destroy the Soulmongerer."
- To Sylvie: "Do you think I can trust her?"
- S: "You cannot trust her. I unknowingly sold your soul to her when I made my pact."
- To Shar: "Is this true?"
- Shar: "Your Mother had a price to pay, for the life I have given her. And now it is time that she pays her debt."
- "Is there any way, I can trust you?"
- Shar: "I am a goddess. I hold my word."
- "That doesn't mean much to me"
- Shar: "Even if this goddess is in possession of your soul already?"
- [[Delwyn]] begins to cry, turns to Sylvie and goes in to hug her.

The maze before us, shines brightly with turquoise energy. Water emerging darts directly toward [[Delwyn]]'s [[Shade Mark]], cleansing it and revealing a normal hand with the maze of [[Ubtao]] on its back.

[[Kadrin]] goes in to meditate
- _As you walk through the maze, your path never branches off. After walking for 10 minutes you arrive at a familiar Location. The maze opens up onto a large circilar plateau made from cut stone. Looking behind you, you see a large cliffside that reaches up far above the clouds. In the distance you see a setting sun above a wast blue ocean. At the edge of the plateau you see a table with two chairs which are made from metal. A plate of cookies sits in the middle of the table._
- goes to the table
- SW: "go ahead Kadrin, eat one, like the good old times"
- _SW appears behind Kadrin_
- "I was wondering where you are. What do you want?"
- SW: "Your cooperation. I may have been a bit... extreme I'd admit."
- "It's a bit late for that insight, isn't it?"
- SW: "I think there is plenty of time, still. If you help me, you will get what you always wanted: become a paladin and save the souls of thousands, millions, billions of souls. Not only in this multiverse but all over every multiverse. All you have to do is cooperate."
- "How would I be able to help people from places I don't even know. It would just give you more Souls through you Zaranite scams."
- SW: "Well that is correct. What do you think will happen to these souls?"
- "You just collect them and then use them for your own wills or send them away. Hubert said something."
- SW: "I am trying to build a utopia for those souls. A world without death where there is no threat or fear of dying."
- "This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"
- SW: "I cannot provide that yet. _slams table_ I need you, because I am cursed. Zaranite spreads my curse and my powers are not perfect yet. When I try to resurrect people it usually takes me a few hundred-thousand times. If I fail I get something like Hubert or Harold were. To make matters worse, I am not able to control my resurrections, every soul I collect is resurrected in my own Plane called Hag'Se. The people who were successfully resurrected formed the Hag'Se organization."
- "So what do you get out of this? You are not doing this out of the good of your heart."
- Insight: 1, INSPIRATION, 17
	- She seems panicked
- SW: "I am doing this because it's the right thing to do. Because it's the only thing I can do. I've seen worlds and all their souls consumed by nothingness. So I am just going to make a World that is everlasting and I will be their everlasting Warden."
- "To be honest, if you just told me about this utopia at the start without betraying me multiple times, I would've followed you to the death. But I know it is you and it's too good to be true. There has to be a catch."
- SW: "I don't lead with these things because it is world breaking for the people to see."
- "Just show me?"
- SW: "I cannot show you what is not yet made. As I said it isn't perfect yet."
- "Out of curiosity, what would happen?"
- SW: "You would become my Avatar and I would partly occupy your body to rid me of this curse. Travel to Mount Celestial and reach the top to cure myself."
- "That is just stealing from other people again."
- SW: "It is a necessary evil"
- "Even though I think you're not lying, I think your plan sounds bad. I... no we will save a lot of people, but you will have no part in this."
- Investigation: 10
	- very faintly something flickers and his surroundings get slightly blurry
- SW: "If you want to help people, just simply eat the cookies."
- _Kadrin takes the plate_
- "So you will be with me and we will help a lot of people, right?"
- SW: "Just eat the cookies."
- "Maybe I will keep your offer in mind, maybe I will try to help you some day. But for now maybe the sea will have a patron for you."
- _Kadrin throws the plate of cookies toward the sea as it shatters on an illusion._
- `As the illusion fades, you see that you are back in a large circular room inside the maze. The only exit to this room lies behind the figure of the Soulscourge who begins to laugh maniaclly. "I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this. but you leave me no choice... but to destroy your soul." the angelic illusion over her falls, revealing a horrible aberration in a roughly humanoid shape with slimy dark green skin, multiple purple eyes and two large tenteacles on her back covered with long claws growing out from them like feathers on a pair of wings. "Now Kadrin, for the sake of everyone, DIE!" The Soulscourge rushes towarrds you, but before she can reach you, she is suddenly knoecked to the ground by a large figure made out of light. The figure begins to bite into the Soulscouge below it and as it does you recognize it for what it is: Its Stomps!`
- _As the whole illusion fades SW says that she will have to resort to destroying Kadrin's Soul as she also transforms into a horrible aberration._
- _The SW rushes toward Kadrin as a figure bites down into SW stopping her. It is Stomps made out of Holy Light._
- _Kadrin jumps onto Stomps saddle_
- _Kadrin thinks of Gannin and he manifests made of Holy Light_
- _Gannin falls back and summons his Astral Self, catching and throwing back the Eldritch Blasts_
- _Delwyn manifests on the back of the saddle, turning into a T-Rex and charges toward SW_
- _Shadow manifests running on a wall nearby. Looking at the maze from above, she marks out a path through the maze with her arrows._
- _Before Kadrin can reach the middle, he is suddenly blocked by a wall, as Stomps is hit by an Eldritch Blast, he disappears. A glowing angelic figure appears above him calling for Kadrin's Chains._
- throws the chains to [[Aratiel]]
- [[Aratiel]] carries him to the middle of the maze, SW close behind
- _Aratiel is hit by an Eldritch Blast as they both fall to the ground, crashing into the crystal in the middle of the maze. SW calls out that they will be unified into one. Aratiel suggests that she wants his light and to "Let her have it then."_
- draws his sword and hits SW into the chest with his sword, wings glowing brightly, as it hits, the form of the SW disintegrates and disappears into brightly lit nothingness.
- [[Aratiel]] says that he doesn't feel the SW presence anymore but she is not gone from the world
	- taking the light from [[Mount Celestia]] would cause unimaginable peril and death for all of the multiverse
	- it would throw everything into imbalance
	- she might have had a good idea but meeting it by all means necessary to that degree is despicable to say the least
- [[Aratiel]]: "Your soul is now cleansed of corruption and truly free. Now it is time for you to become the true paladin you always wished for"
- K: I" believe and i swear that i'll do anything in my power to help as many as i can and i will fight alongside of my companions. I protect them as they protect me. I will protect those that cannot protect themselves. I will rid this world and whatever there is of the darkness that hides. And I just- want everyone to live a peaceful life. And help everyone overcome their dark sides and rid them of their evil."
- [[Aratiel]]: "And al"
