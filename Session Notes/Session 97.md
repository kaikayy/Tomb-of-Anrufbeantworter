Recap - [[Kadrin]]

We make camp
- [[Talsen]] hangs up his Ogre Pelt to dry
	- gives [[Delwyn]] the Red Wizards Spellbook
- [[Kadrin]] asks [[Kordelia]] to join us
	- she accepts
	- Ka: Where did you go after you left back then?
	- Ko: Traveled around the Sword Coast to see the big cities
	- Did Mercenary work
	- later met [[Artus Cimber]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]
	- snuck onto his boat while he was leaving for [[Chult]]
	- followed him around since then
	- Ka: Why did you never return or said anything about it?
	- Ko: You can blame Dad for that, the small village life wasn't for me
	- Ka: We could've done this together
	- Ko: Yeah, I didn't know if you were ready yet
	- Ka: Still don't feel ready
	- Ko: You look pretty ready to me
	- Ka: How did you survive?
	- Ko: I'm pretty good with a sword, I've survived so far
	- Ka: I've searched for you for so long, I don't want you to be in danger anymore.
	- Ko: I'm not really in danger or something here, the [[Yuan-Ti]] are no match. we can just fall back if we are to get overwhelmed, we're quite fast
	- Ka: I guess I can't tell you what to do. Where would you go if you'd leave [[Chult]] right now?
	- Ko: I don't know. I was planning to hang out in the [[City of Mezro]] with [[Artus Cimber]] some more, maybe stay there.
	- Ko: [[Artus Cimber]] got the [[Ring of Winter]] from the [[Frost Giants]] as a mission from the [[Harpers]], then the [[City of Mezro]] disappeared while he was away. It stops you from aging but it also seems to be quite evil.
		- It can't be destroyed by any normal means but has to be put on the hand of some summer queen in the Fey Realm

	- Ko: A couple of months
