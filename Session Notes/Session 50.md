_[[Kadrin]]'s Dream:
Surrounded by Darkness, reminds him of the Dreams with the "Betrayer God".
Perception: 12. 
Can't seem to tell up from down or left from right.
He spots a little star, far off in the distance.
Can't seem to even know if he has arms, legs, a body. There seems to be no physical form.
He tries talking, asking: "What is this? [[Hubris]]? Anyone? Weird Voice?"
Perception: 2.
He hears only silence, the faintest of sounds pierces it, but he can't seem to make out what it might be._
