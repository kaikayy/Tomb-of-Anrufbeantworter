Recap - [[Kadrin]]

We approach the one building on the upper ledge cautiously
- [[Shadow]] looks around, Perception: 23
	- Sees no people, just some birds
	- Approaches and looks through the window
		- Seems like a ruined Temple with a big arch on one wall
- We go around the building and find the nearly broken down door and open it

Going inside we see etchings on the walls and a burnt-out campfire
- The Etchings read:
	- “Fear the fangs of [[Ras Nsi]]!” 
	- “Erik, I’ve gone in search of the nine shrines. V.” 
	- “The puzzle cubes are the key.” 
	- “Beware the frog monster!” 
	- “Who is Unkh?” 
	- “All hail the King of Feathers!” 
	- “The snakes are not what they seem.” “Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?”

	- The Campfire has been here for a good while
- [[Shadow]] goes ahead and looks at the archway
	- Arcana: 17
		- The Runes on the archway seems to be pertaining to [[Ubtao]]
- [[Talsen]] tries to look for the Maze etching, Perception: 16
	- At the top of the Archway is a pristine maze-like structure
	- The Square Altar also has a Maze without a solution in it
- [[Kadrin]] keeps watch outside of the building, Perception: 11
- [[Shadow]] climbs up the wall to see the way through the Maze better, communicating to copy the solution

We now have a way to get to [[Omu]] via the [[Webway of Ubtao]]
We reconvene and tuck away at the bottom of the stairs a bit
- [[Kadrin]] wants to check on the mounts, [[Talsen]] comes with
	- [[Shadow]] looks out from inside of the building
		- Perception: 25
	- We arrive at [[Stomps]] and the other mounts, they seem fine
	- [[Kadrin]] casts Speak with Animals and asks [[Stomps]] if he's seen anyone
		- Persuasion: 12
			- Seen a Monkey but couldn't get it
		- Apologizes to [[Stomps]] for the climbing and jumping
		- [[Stomps]] seems to accept the apology and asks if him and [[Kadrin]] can work together on killing and eating [[Shadow]]'s Strider
		- [[Kadrin]] denies the request but promises to go hunting for a giant chicken like creature with him next time we travel
			- Persuasion: Nat. 20 (28)
		- [[Kadrin]] asks [[Stomps]] to alert us when he sees any Dwarf nearby
	- [[Shadow]] hears stones moving through the door and a large snake slithers in
		- Jumps up onto the Altar
		- The Snake transforms into a half-humanoid form, a [[Yuan-Ti]]
		- Hears more sounds from outside
		- ### [[Fight_S46]]

We start to pursue the [[Yuan-Ti]] running from us
- [[Kadrin]] Perception: 6
	- Sees no [[Yuan-Ti]]
- [[Talsen]] calls out not to follow further
- [[Kadrin]] Perception: 6
	- Shoots at a rattling bush
		- 19 to hit, Shoots a Bird
- [[Kadrin]] comes back
- [[Talsen]] climbs back up the wall
- [[Shadow]] tries to look through a window of the nearest house but it's too dirty
	- Perception: 23
		- Seems like blue mist is covering the interior hiding anything from sight
- [[Kadrin]] collects the bodies, [[Talsen]] notices the Longbow, carved like a Serpent adorned with amber gems
	- [[Talsen]], Arcana: 8
- We reconvene and go back up the stairs towards the Mounts, [[Kadrin]] dragging one of the bodies of the [[Yuan-Ti]]

### SHORT REST
- The Longbow is non magical and is more valuable with the gems inlayed in it
- [[Kadrin]], Animal Handling: 16
	- [[Stomps]] seems to devour the [[Yuan-Ti]] happily
