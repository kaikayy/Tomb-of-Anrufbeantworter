Recap - [[Kadrin]]

[[Talsen]] cuts off a piece of skin from one of the [[Firenewt]]s and takes a vial of blood from one of them
[[Kadrin]] picks up the [[Firenewt]]'s nets
[[Shadow]] searches through the camp
- Investigation: 17
	- Explorer's Pack
		- Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, a waterskin and has 50 feet of hempen rope
		- 27 Rations
			- Picks up all the rations and loads them onto [[Stomps]]

[[Delwyn]] loots the [[Firenewt]]s
- Investigation: 16
	- Nothing of value

We decide to do a Short Rest in the camp, [[Kadrin]] casts Spirit Shroud into Vorn
##### SHORT REST (Start)
- [[Talsen]] tries to mix the [[Firenewt]] Skin with his Mutagens
	- d100(88), creates a bright orange concoction
- [[Delwyn]] whittles away at his flute
	- DEX: [[Nat.20]] (23)
		- The flute is nearly finished
##### SHORT REST (End)

We make our way towards the [[Valley of Lost Honor]]
- at the end of the day we arrive to the Valley and a flowing volcano can be seen in the distance
	- a wasteland of ash sprawling before us, small dunes are the only thing that hinders our view from the whole valley
- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense
	- nothing
- [[Delwyn]] camouflages his face and hair with ash

We make camp on one of the big spikes still jutting out of the ash

1. Watch - [[Shadow]], [[Kadrin]]
- Perc.: Nat.1 (7), INSPIRATION, 16, 15
- They both hear the flapping of wings in the distance, as suddenly 200-300 feet away the dunes are drenched in flame as the head of a red dragon flashes shortly. Screams erupt briefly and then silence. The wing sounds flap away westward.

2. Watch - [[Delwyn]], [[Shago]]
- Perc.: 12, 10
-  [[Delwyn]] whittles at his flute, DEX: 7

3. Watch -  [[Talsen]], [[Musharib]]
- Perc.: 4, 6

#### LONG REST -> Day 12
Weather: Ash Fall, slight wind
[[Kadrin]] cooks, DEX: 12

[[Talsen]] asks [[Delwyn]] about the [[Firenewt]]s performance in darkness
- They apparently can't see too much in the darkness

We travel and make haste to arrive at [[Hrakhamar]] in the evening
- Our footing grows more firm after some way as we discover a cobbled street under our feet
- [[Musharib]] tells us it is the Street from [[Hrakhamar]] to [[Shilku]]
	- It is covered in ash sometimes but it's more than usual
	- A volcanic eruption forced the [[Albino Dwarfs]] to leave the forge and after they came back the [[Firenewt]] took it over
	- There is hopefully a small pocket of still surviving dwarfs near the forge in a cave
- At the end of the day we see a cave entrance in the distance
	- `The entrance is a 10-foot-tall arched doorway beneath a massive relief carving of a crossed hammer and tongs. Two iron doors were fitted to the entrance, but one lies on the ground, completely rusted off its hinges, and the other sags so badly it appears as if it could collapse at any moment. Several buildings once stood outside the forge, but they’ve been reduced to their foundations.`
	- [[Shadow]] sees the ghostly [[Almiraj]] again, it hops towards an area with a lot of rubble and makes a digging motion
		- [[Shadow]] follows it, it hops up the stacked rubble
			- Perception: 20
				- A small man made podium can be seen on top of the rubble
			- Cleans off the podium and takes a look at it
				- A symbol of [[Ubtao]] can be seen on it
		- [[Talsen]] comes up to the podium, it seems to be one of the [[Webway of Ubtao]], goes back down and tells the others
			- The address seems to be covered by rubble and there is no arch for the portal to be found
	- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense
		- nothing
	- We discuss if we first alarm [[Musharib]]'s friends to back us up or not
		- We decide not to until the situation looks dire
	- We prepare for battle and leave [[Stomps]] and [[Vorn]] out of it

### We enter [[Hrakhamar]]

MA: [[Talsen]], [[Kadrin]], [[Shadow]], [[Delwyn]], [[Musharib]], [[Shago]]

We try to sneak
- [[Kadrin]] casts Silent Image around [[Talsen]] and himself
- [[Musharib]] casts Pass without a trace on everyone
	- Stealth:
		- [[Talsen]]: Nat.1 (12)
		- [[Kadrin]]: 25
		- [[Shadow]]: 40
		- [[Delwyn]]: 25
		- [[Musharib]]: 30
		- [[Shago]]: 27
			- ⌀: 26,5
- [[Talsen]] looks around the first corner
	- more minecart track
- On the other side of the bridge something scratches at the ground and looks up occasionally
	- Like the guardian of the bridge, we see a rooster
	- [[Talsen]] asks [[Shadow]] to shoot it down
		- SHARPSHOOTER, 23 to hit, 21 DMG
			- the rooster poofs away
- [[Talsen]] looks into the next area
	- it's filled with smoke and we can make out a lantern further down
	- `The size and shape of this area are impossible to determine. Clouds of roiling smoke sting your eyes, and drifting embers burn your throat as you breathe. You can, however, barely make out what looks like a lantern farther back in the smoke.`
- We keep going onto the bridge
	- `A cavern of molten magma bubbles and flames before you. The cavern walls are lined with metal gantries and cranes that support immense crucibles of scorched clay. Huge chains stretch across the cavern, apparently to shuttle multi-ton buckets of ore across the lava. The heat takes your breath away, brings water to your eyes, and bakes your skin. From where you stand, the only obvious way across is via a narrow stone trestle built for rail carts. The sound of rhythmic hammering comes from somewhere beyond the magma rift.`
- [[Kadrin]] looks around and uses Divine Sense
	- Perception: 2
	- nothing
	- changes the Silent Image to a smoke wall around us
- We cross the bridge at the brink of melting alive
- Following more minecart tracks we arrive at another crossing and look into the large room to our right
	- `The hammering sound grows louder, but it’s not coming from the chamber ahead. This enormous, rectangular chamber is a working smelter. A rectangular pit in the center of the room is filled with molten iron. Six devices of dwarven design and make, arranged around the pit, siphon off the liquid metal and draw out the impurities. A smaller pool in the southeast corner holds what appears to be molten silver. Creatures that look like a mix of humanoid amphibians and elemental fire are tending to the machines. So far, they haven’t noticed you.`

- [[Talsen]] passes down tactics through the Marching Order
- [[Delwyn]] warns for backup but [[Shadow]] doesn't pass it through
- [[Talsen]] grabs [[Kadrin]]'s arm and rushes into the battle
	- [[Kadrin]] shifts the smoke cloud forward one last time
	- [[Shadow]] cocks an arrow
