**How did you first meet Ye'sus-uz?**
Just after appearing on the Material Plane, he was playing in the streets.
	He was the first one to greet Enixif and offered to show her the way - he wasn't really that helpful

**How did you keep in contact with Ye'sus-uz?**
He sends me Sending Spells every third Tuesday on the dot, informing me on what he is seeing right in this moment, I answer by telling him what I'm seeing around me in the moment.
