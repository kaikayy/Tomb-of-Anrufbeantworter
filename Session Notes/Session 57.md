Recap - [[Kadrin]]

We awaken in [[Talsen]]'s Shack
We Plan to buy stuff at [[Wakanga O’tamu]]'s and meet with [[Ekene-Afa]]

We head into [[Port Nyanzaru]] and grab [[Gecko-Kebabs]] to-go and a vegetable skewer for [[Shadow]]

We go over to the [[Merchants' Ward]] to request audiences with [[Ekene-Afa]], [[Zhanthi]] and [[Wakanga O’tamu]]

Later we want to look for a Guide who is knowledgeable in or near the [[Mistcliff Mountains]]

[[Kadrin]] does a short check-up on [[Zitembe]], [[Steve]] and the [[Temple of Savras]]

We arrive at [[Zhanthi]]'s House and are let in with our still valid invitation
- We present 
	- 9x 50gp gemstones
	- the black pearl (700gp)
	- 5 golden cups (250gp)
	- the golden statue of Sibyl (300gp) and 
	- the amber adorned bow
- She closely inspects all the items and offers 2000gp
	- [[Kadrin]] asks for something useful for us as a Trade instead
		- She offers us imported Armor for 3x the Price
- [[Shago]] brings in a thick cloth to lay the pieces out, he is the son of [[Zhanthi]]
	- He can be hired as a guide and wants [[Kadrin]] to cook for him as "they have a kitchen here"
	- He knows the northern Parts of [[Chult]] and knows the way to [[Fort Beluarian]]
- We accept her offer and the gold is brought out to us
- [[Talsen]] asks if she might know more about the Red Vase we acquired in [[Hisari]]
	- Since it's potentially dangerous, she would advice to identify it first and she might buy it afterwards if it might be considered an artwork
	- [[Wakanga O’tamu]] and Harbor Master [[Zindar]] are able to identify objects
- She elaborates on [[The Flaming Fist]] Quest
	- She suspects them to cooperate with the [[Pirate Captains]]
	- The Leader of [[The Flaming Fist]], [[Liara Portyr]] is hiding Evidence in [[Fort Beluarian]]
	- Infiltrate the Fort, retrieve the Evidence and bring it back to [[Zhanthi]] 
	- There is a Spy, [[Zhanthi]] hired for this exact purpose, his name is [[Rokah]]
	- We can just accompany [[Rokah]] and cause a distraction inside the Fort for him to acquire the evidence
	- She thinks it's better to keep the [[Zhentarim]] close to monitor their actions instead of leaving all of it in the shadows
- We leave [[Zhanthi]]'s House
	- [[Kadrin]] looks back, Perception: 5
