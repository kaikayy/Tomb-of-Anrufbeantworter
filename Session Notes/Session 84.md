[[Talsen]] leads the party to the building marked [[Kubazan’s Shrine]]
- No one in the party knows the name
- [[Delwyn]], History: 18
	- Knows that the building was built for a deity that is kind of frog like or related to frogs
- [[Talsen]] knows it was built by the [[Omuen]] (Human and Minotaurs)
- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense
	- Nothing

_A rectangular pool of murky water stretches before this vine-draped shrine. Rope bridges that once spanned the water float on the surface, tangled with other debris. The shards of a toppled monolith form stepping stones to the middle of the pool, where a statue of a stone frog rises above the water._
- [[Talsen]] looks around
	- Perception: 12
		- It's eerily quiet, and no one is around
- We take a look at the monoliths, they are blank and made of stone
- [[Shadow]] takes a look at the Frog Statue in the Water
	- Perception: 11
		- Something is laying on the tongue of the frog
- [[Delwyn]] uses Shape Water to split the Water, sees that it is slightly deeper than 5ft.
	- A tongue jumps out of the water and grabs [[Delwyn]] to pull him in
	- STR SAV: 8
- ### [[Fight_S84]]
- [[Kadrin]] takes [[Nankore, Spear of Lost Love]] back to [[Talsen]]
- [[Shadow]] goes to check out the tongue of the frog
	- There is a small stone key on it, she picks it up
- There is a carving above the door in Old [[Omuen]]
	- _“Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take.”_
- [[Talsen]] checks the door for Traps
	- Investigation: 13
		- no traps
- [[Shadow]] uses the key to open the door

_Steps descend to a ledge overlooking a pit of sharpened stakes. An alcove on the far wall holds a pedestal with a stone cube resting on it. A relief carved into the back of the alcove shows a monstrous frog with tentacles fighting a crane. Wooden beams radiate from the walls at floor height, with four-foot gaps between them. Carved frog heads extrude from the walls above the beams._
- [[Talsen]] jumps across the spike pit towards the cube on the pedestal
- [[Shadow]] looks at the wooden beams

		- Acrobatics: 19
	- As she lands on the second beam, the first one retracts into the wall, as does the second one after that, the others she landed on follow
- [[Talsen]] takes a look at the cube without touching it
	- 3in. cube with a depiction of the [[Froghemoth]] on all sides
	- History: 20
		- Knows that traps like these are usually triggered by weight
	- Investigation: 22
		- The Cube weighs about 0,5 lb.
- [[Kadrin]] & [[Shago]] stand ready at the door to hold it open

	- Gets out safely with the [[Puzzle Cube of Kubazan]]
- [[Kadrin]] heals [[Delwyn]] for 5 HP with Lay on Hands

We discuss where to go next and how safe it is to do with [[Delwyn]]
We designate [[Kubazan’s Shrine]] as our spot to regroup if we lose each other

We decide on [[Shagambi’s Shrine]] to be our next destination
- We move towards the location quietly and attentively
	- Stealth:
		- [[Kadrin]]: 17
		- [[Talsen]]: 17
		- [[Shadow]]: 21
		- [[Shago]]: 19
		- [[Delwyn]]: 18
			- ⌀: 18,4
	- Perception:
		- [[Shadow]]:  Nat.20 (26)
			- Hears [[Hugo]] roar far away
		- [[Delwyn]]: 16

We arrive at [[Shagambi’s Shrine]]
- We see two adult [[Kamadan]] prowling around a destroyed cart guarding their three young
- We sneak around the domed building to the other side
- _A ruined shrine stands at the heart of this walled compound. Tall monoliths flank the entrance, decorated with images of a jaguar with six snakes sprouting from its shoulders. A stone door is set into the shrine beyond._
- We move towards the door
- [[Talsen]] checks the door for Traps
	- Investigation: 24
		- The Stone doors do not appear to be trapped
- There are carvings in the monolith depicting a [[Kamadan]] protecting Chultan Fighters training
	- The Text reads _"Shagambi teaches us to fight evil with honor.”_
- [[Shadow]] tries to open the door, but isn't strong enough
	- [[Kadrin]] joins in to try
		- Sleight of Hand:
			- [[Shadow]]: 18
			- [[Kadrin]]: 7
				- The Door still makes a sound while being opened
	- As the door opens, there is silence, we seems to have avoided the [[Kamadan]]'s attention

We go inside the Shrine
- _Steps descend into a fifteen-foot-high, moss-covered room. Four statues of Omuan warriors stand in alcoves to either side, overlooking a barred gladiatorial pit in the floor. Each statue looks like it was meant to hold a spear, but its weapon is missing. On the far side of the chamber, a stone pedestal stands conspicuously bare. A relief on the wall behind it shows a monstrous jaguar with six snakes protruding from its shoulders, fighting off a squat, frog-like humanoid armed with a spear. To the left of the relief is a narrow tunnel with stairs leading down._
