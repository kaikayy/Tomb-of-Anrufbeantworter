Recap - [[Talsen]]


---
[[Kadrin]]:
Light blinging his eyes, then total darkness, he doesn't seem to have a body and sees nothing around him.
A light approaches and flies towards him, looking closer it seems to be a creature with wings that first appeared in [[Hisari]] when he grabbed the [[Longsword of Purging]]. The creature looks similar to him but older, it has wings, glowing eyes and hair.

A voice appears as hear before by him, labeled as the "Betrayer God"
- Finally I was able to reach you
- I don't know what you did but you seem to have temporarily stunned her, or at least the corruption in your heart
- K: Who are you
- Right, I am [[Aratiel]], I am an ancestor of yours, I am not sure how many generations have passed. During my lifetime I was a devout paladin and ascended to "mount celestia" after my passing.
- K: We are related? It should surprise me a lot more, but after all that I've learned about myself this is...woah. You said you used to be a Paladin, so you're not a god?
- Indeed, I am but a servant of a god. A god that has chosen you as his champion. To fulfil his prophecy
- K: So a god has chosen me, and it is not the [[Soul Warden]]?
- No, "Soul Scourge" has interfered with this prophecy. You were supposed to save the world but then she ([[Soul Warden]]) came around.
- K: What god are we talking about, I don't understand?

_The sound of ice cracking can be heard and [[Aratiel]]_

- It seems we do not have much time. I don't know what you did to stun her but she corrupted you deeply.
- K: Please wait, I need more information. A Name? Anything?
- Ask the Naga of [[Orolunga]] where you could potentially find a sacred place to get rid of the corruption.
- He will always be by your side, just know that. [[Lathender]] the Dawn Lord.

_Black tendrils break the connection between [[Aratiel]] and [[Kadrin]] as he reaches out for him. Another loud cracking sound is heard.
A giant City in it's prime can be seen from a higher up perspective, he looks down a Ziggurat, [[Orolunga]], in it's prime. The sun rising in front of us._

[[Talsen]], [[Shadow]] and [[Delwyn]] all cough up smoke beside him at the same time.

[[Kadrin]] grants [[Delwyn]] 7 HP

[[Kadrin]] asks if we all saw something coming here
- We deny it.
- [[Kadrin]] tells us about his encounter and to ask the Naga Guardian

We hear a voice behind us offering its assistance. Inside the Ziggurat w
