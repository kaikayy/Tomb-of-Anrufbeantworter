Recap - [[Talsen]]


---
[[Kadrin]]:
Light blinging his eyes, then total darkness, he doesn't seem to have a body and sees nothing around him.
A light approaches and flies towards him, looking closer it seems to be a creature with wings that first appeared in [[Hisari]] when he grabbed the [[Longsword of Purging]]. The creature looks similar to him but older, it has wings, glowing eyes and hair.
![[We're so fucked.png]]
A voice appears as hear before by him, labeled as the "Betrayer God"
- Finally I was able to reach you
- I don't know what you did but you seem to have temporarily stunned her, or at least the corruption in your heart
- K: Who are you
- Right, I am [[Aratiel]], I am an ancestor of yours, I am not sure how many generations have passed. During my lifetime I was a devout paladin and ascended to "mount celestia" after my passing.
- K: We are related? It should surprise me a lot more, but after all that I've learned about myself this is...woah. You said you used to be a Paladin, so you're not a god?
- Indeed, I am but a servant of a god. A god that has chosen you as his champion. To fulfil his prophecy
- K: So a god has chosen me, and it is not the [[Soul Warden]]?
- No, "Soul Scourge" has interfered with this prophecy. You were supposed to save the world but then she ([[Soul Warden]]) came around.
- K: What god are we talking about, I don't understand?

_The sound of ice cracking can be heard and [[Aratiel]]_

- It seems we do not have much time. I don't know what you did to stun her but she corrupted you deeply.
- K: Please wait, I need more information. A Name? Anything?
- Ask the Naga of [[Orolunga]] where you could potentially find a sacred place to get rid of the corruption.
- He will always be by your side, just know that. [[Lathender]] the Dawn Lord.

_Black tendrils break the connection between [[Aratiel]] and [[Kadrin]] as he reaches out for him. Another loud cracking sound is heard.
A giant City in it's prime can be seen from a higher up perspective, he looks down a Ziggurat, [[Orolunga]], in it's prime. The sun rising in front of us._

[[Talsen]], [[Shadow]] and [[Delwyn]] all cough up smoke beside him at the same time.

[[Kadrin]] grants [[Delwyn]] 7 HP

[[Kadrin]] asks if we all saw something coming here
- We deny it.
- [[Kadrin]] tells us about his encounter and to ask the Naga Guardian

`Hanging lamps illuminate the room, while incense burners fill it with exotic scents and curling smoke. Cushions and reed mats cover the floor, pots of blooming flowers line the plastered walls, and singing birds flit from plant to plant. An immense snake with iridescent scales rests on a heap of cushions opposite the doorway. It rises slowly to a height of 5 feet, staring directly into your eyes as it moves. Its face is remarkably humanlike, and its tongue flicks before it speaks. “I am Saja N’baza. What do you seek in this ancient place? Speak truly, for I hear your hearts!”`
We hear a voice behind us offering its assistance. Inside the Ziggurat we see the Naga Guardian of [[Orolunga]], [[Saja N’baza]]
- It asks us to speak truly as it can tell if we're not
	- Why have we come to this ancient place
- It will only attack us in self-defense, we should have a seat as we have "All the time in the world"
- [[Talsen]] asks what city this is?
	- It is [[Orolunga]] in its prime, in our time only the Ziggurat remains
	- Right now, we are in a place outside of time, so we have all the time in the world
- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense and he notices that also his normal senses have grown stronger.
	- He can sense [[Hubris]] now, something in him, it is weird.
- [[Shadow]] and [[Delwyn]] take a seat on the cushions on the ground
- [[Delwyn]] casts Shape Water to create a curved lens to see the city better but it fails
- [[Talsen]] History: 16 - A Long Lost civilization, no people around but the buildings in their prime, at least 500years old maybe 1000years. The previous inhabitants were Humans of Chultan heritage.
- [[Delwyn]] INT: 5 - Can't really ascertain how many people lived here once
- [[Kadrin]] sits down.

[[Saja N’baza]] ask what Wisdom we seek in [[Orolunga]]
- [[Kadrin]] asks about the thing that you can only ask one question
	- We have all the time in the world
- [[Talsen]] asks about repercussions for staying here
	- None but that you can't go here again, as its master [[Ubtao]] said so
- [[Kadrin]] asks if it gets lonely
	- No i get quite a few visitors
- [[Delwyn]] asks for the weather tomorrow
	- That is something you'll have to find out
- [[Talsen]] asks about the boundaries of it's knowledge
	- It knows some things of our time, some things that have happened and some things that will happen, but not everything
	- Some are obtained through visions, some through agents
	- These Agents are snakes and can come and go how they want because [[Ubtao]] permitted it
- [[Kadrin]] asks what it wants in return
	- There is nothing we have to give her but there is something of urgency it wants to get done
	- It is something we have to do for it, not just for it but for Chult and the entire world
- [[Kadrin]] asks if it's the [[Death Curse]]
	- It doesn't know what that is, it wants us to kill [[Ras Nsi]]
- [[Talsen]] asks how we should be doing that?
	- [[Ras Nsi]] is in [[Omu]], he is the leader of the [[Yuan-Ti]] there and he is seeking to end the world. He is attempting to awaken / release [[Dendar the Night Serpent]] to bring her to the material plane and devour the sun and usher in an age of eternal darkness.
	- [[Dendar the Night Serpent]] was imprisoned deep beneath the [[Peaks of Flame]]
	- [[Saja N’baza]] doesn't know if [[Ras Nsi]] is actually capable of this but the reports of [[Omu]] are getting worse, so it's finally time to get rid of him.
- [[Talsen]] asks how much longer we have left
	- It doesn't know, doesn't seem to be an easy task, they are looking for an artifact that is rumored to be in [[Omu]] but they have not found it yet.
- [[Shadow]] asks if it's the [[Soulmongerer]]
	- It doesn't know what this is, they ear searching for the [[Black Opal Crown]]
- [[Talsen]] asks for its relationship with [[Yuan-Ti]]
	- They are or were enemies and only seek pure evil
- [[Talsen]] asks if it knows about [[The Hissing]]
	- It was created by the former leader of the [[Yuan-Ti]], [[Ssaztehsi]], it is glad that his temple now crumbled into the ground

Q&A
- The [[Vegepygme]] were originally foreign in the jungle but they adapted nice
- [[Ras Nsi]] was given immortality by [[Ubtao]], it still lingers but a little bit weaker. He is not invulnerable but immortal, he can die by sword but not by other natural causes.
	- His ability include, raise and control the dead, he is quite versed in the arcane and divine art, he is also quite capable with a sword.
	- He also wields a magical sword that ignites and cuts through enemies like butter
	- He has the lower body of a [[Yuan-Ti]] and will be able to ensnare you if you get close
- Looks at [[Talsen]] and advises him to caution with the knowledge and powers he dabbles in. They were originally created by [[Yuan-Ti]]. Do not use them for evil and do not pass them on.

More Q&A
- [[Delwyn]] asks about the 10 [[Aspects of Ubtao]]
	- There are way more than just 10 Aspects. As he decided to split himself, he split into many Aspects to watch over the land. They can be found all over [[Chult]]
		- Are they evil?
			- Some are, some are not. [[Ubtao]] was a very whimsical god. But he wished for all living beings on [[Chult]] to thrive
				- Are there 10 particularly bad or good ones?
					- Hard to tell, which ones are good, which ones are bad. Some can be quite ill-tempered but I wouldn't classify any of them as bad per se.
						- How strong are the Aspects?
							- Why do you wish to know so much about these Aspects of my Master
								- Just interested. Deception: 12
									- [[Shadow]] Insight: 18
										- Strange behaviour from [[Delwyn]]
	- [[Saja N’baza]]: There is something you're not telling me
- [[Delwyn]]: How forgiving are you? Be honest.
	- That depends if your actions are deemed worth forgiving.
- Lets just say I have a problem and its not that old. (Shows his hand)
	- I see, she marked her, a [[Shade Mark]], it was given to you by the Goddess [[Shar]]. If it is left to grow you will become but a Shade and will be bound to [[Shar]] in the [[Shadowfell]]
- [[Delwyn]] explains how he got the [[Shade Mark]] and asks if he can stop it and if he can safe his mother. He asked about the [[Aspects of Ubtao]] because he wanted to know if they are nice people as he doesn't want to kill nice people.
	- Insight: 
		- [[Kadrin]]: 5
		- [[Shadow]]: 22
	- Charisma [[Delwyn]]: 16
		- [[Delwyn]] speaks the truth
- [[Delwyn]] asks if he will get rid of the [[Shade Mark]] and free his mother if he destroys the [[Soulmongerer]]
	- [[Saja N’baza]]: That I cannot say, however it seems like your mother has made some kind of pact with [[Shar]] before your birth and you were the price she paid.
	- I recommend that you seek out [[Shar]] herself, I can sense her presence in [[Port Nyanzaru]]. It is most likely in a place where people go when they have lost everything.
	- The Second Path would be to cleanse this [[Shade Mark]]. Whitin the City of [[Omu]] lies a hidden Temple that can cleanse corruption, impurity, people. It remains hidden to the [[Yuan-Ti]] as of now. There is an agent in [[Omu]] that can help you find the entrance. You will find her in the form of a Chultan Woman, adorned with many colorful feathers and a staff. her name is [[Eku]].
- When I cleanse this mark, how do I save my mother?
	- Maybe destroying the [[Soulmongerer]] will set her free
	- Maybe you have to find a way to break the contract that she made with [[Shar]]
	- For now you should free yourself from this contract and cleanse your hand or speak with [[Shar]]
- [[Kadrin]] asks if this Temple might cleanse [[Hubris]]
	- I have not seen corruption like this before, on you and the staff you carry. I do not believe the Shrine would be enough to safe your friend. There is an artifact in the city of [[Omu]], The [[Eye of Zaltec]] brought here from the continent of [[Maztica]] that is said to bring anyone back to life without boundaries.
- [[Delwyn]] asks if there is any way to safe his mother
	- I cannot say, there certainly is a possibility but I do not know how.
	- I cannot tell for certain if you would lose the connection to your mother once you cleanse your [[Shade Mark]].
- [[Delwyn]] asks how long it takes for this [[Shade Mark]] to corrupt him completely
	- To my estimation it will consume you in roughly 30 days
- [[Talsen]] asks of if it knows about the [[Trade Princes]]
	- The recent death of one of them has imbalanced the power
	- The purge of the pirate threat has bettered the trade of the city but also more people in general and also cultists are coming into the city spreading dooming news. Which is probably related to the bad omens from [[Omu]].
	- [[Jessamine]] has died
