We move on to [[Wongo's Shrine]]
- `Carvings of monkeys hanging by their tails decorate two cracked obelisks that stand before a shrine enclosed by broken walls. Past the obelisks is a courtyard filled with horsetails and arum lilies. Five archways open into darkness at the base of the ruin. Mounted above the central arch is a stone plaque bearing a cuneiform inscription.`
- The Inscription reads: `“Better to be Wongo’s friend than his enemy.”`
