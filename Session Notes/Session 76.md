Recap - [[Talsen]]

[[Talsen]] finds garbage piles as nests which the [[Firenewt]]s use as sleeping accommodations
[[Musharib]] tells us the rooms ahead were storage rooms and the [[Gauntlet of Moradin]] should be over the bridge where the Pig was

[[Shadow]] takes a look in the other trashed rooms
- Finds a few barrels that are still intact with dice on top
- The [[Firenewt]]s used them as sleeping quarters
- Goes through the corridor
	- Perception: 19
		- Hears the grunting of the Pig
		- Hears the clashing of metal from the other side of the lava river

[[Delwyn]] tries to leave for the Pig
- [[Kadrin]] advises against it

[[Talsen]] levies to push on to look for more survivors
- [[Kadrin]] agrees and heals [[Talsen]] for 5 HP
	- heals himself for 4 HP

We go to get the Unconscious Albino Dwarf ([[Foznem Axeshaper]]) from the main chamber to leave him in the area we were before with [[Shago]] and then push on for survivors
- We go back through the metal smithing and armory rooms
- [[Talsen]] takes a look at the armor
	- Well made armor for Dwarfs, Half Plate Armor, a bit scrached
	- There also seems to be a lot of weapons here
		- `This chamber includes six each of battleaxes, greataxes, mauls, morningstars, war picks, warhammers, and heavy crossbows, plus two hundred crossbow bolts and four suits of dwarven half-plate armor.`

We go towards the Pig
