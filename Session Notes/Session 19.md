Recap - [[Kadrin]]

We discuss wether to go to [[Tiryki Anchorage]] and buy a Dinosaur as an offering for [[Aremag the Dragon Turtle]] or go to sleep right away.
[[Gannin]] notices a noble looking gentleman looking towards their direction, [[Kairi]] goes over and asks what he wants.
He wants to trade us a sailing ship to map out some areas, his name is [[Lerek Dashlynd]].
- He wants to know the location of [[Orolunga]] and [[Nangalore]]

	- He accepts our Trade for 2 [[Kairi]]'s Feathers and the Feathers of [[Gannin]]'s [[Batiri]] Mask

We make our way to [[Tiryki Anchorage]] and see the [[Guards of Port Nyanzaru]] at the gate again.
[[Kadrin]] asks the Chultan Guard if can come back into the City if we leave here and not go into the Jungle.
- [[The Flaming Fist]] usually only target people who they think who are returning from adventuring
- We can ask him if [[The Flaming Fist]] is bothering us

We arrive at the [[Dinosaur Stables]] and see many different kinds of Dinosaurs.
We see a smaller elder gentleman and [[Kadrin]] asks him if the DInosaurs are for sale.
- They are for sale

[[Shadow]] looks out for the Dragon Turtle.
[[Kadrin]] talks to [[Hubris]] about being a hero and if he has changed like [[Kairi]] said.
- [[Hubris]] knows Fürst [[Troy]] and he is thankful that he "ate dust" in the Arena.
- Fürst [[Troy]] was one of [[Hubris]] former students. 
- Doesn't really wanna talk about it. 
- [[Kadrin]] notices that [[Hubris]] was not always a Sword and starts having doubts about [[Hubris]] not talking to the [[Soul Warden]].

We all notice the ship getting really slow and grinding to a halt slowly but surely. We come to a standstill and are being pushed backwards.
The Captain calls out for everyone getting in position and the Boat starts rotating.

[[Aremag the Dragon Turtle]] starts emerging infront of the ship and sharkfins start circling the ship turning a little vortex around it.
