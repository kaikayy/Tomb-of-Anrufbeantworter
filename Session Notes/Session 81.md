- [[Zindar]] says that [[Bolnir Copperhandle]] was monitored by two [[Ytepka Society]] Agents

We make our way to [[Omu]] through the [[Webway of Ubtao]]
- We see the etchings on the walls again
	- `“Fear the fangs of Ras Nsi!” “Erik, I’ve gone in search of the nine shrines. V.” “The puzzle cubes are the key.” “Beware the frog monster!” “Who is Unkh?” “All hail the King of Feathers!” “The snakes are not what they seem.” “Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?”`
