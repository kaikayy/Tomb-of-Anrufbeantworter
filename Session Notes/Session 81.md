Recap - [[Kadrin]]

## Flashback

[[Talsen]] & [[Shadow]] sit with [[Alji Wiggleback]]
- A flapping grows louder and something impacts on one of the roofs nearby
-  It's Harbor Master [[Zindar]]
	- he says he needs to talk to us, now
- [[Alji Wiggleback]] leaves for the Kitchen
- [[Zindar]] says that [[Bolnir Copperhandle]] was monitored by two [[Ytepka Society]] Agents
	- they have been found dead this morning
	- He seems to have a powerful ally, it was only him at first, but there was a single mark like something only touched the floor once
	- The [[Ytepka Society]] Agents were killed by the magic "Cloud Kill"
	- If we find out who did this, there is a Bounty on this Spellcasters and [[Bolnir Copperhandle]]'s Head for 1000gp each
	- The Footprints were Humanoid, wearing shoes, human sized
- [[Talsen]] offers [[Zindar]] to spar when they are back in town.
