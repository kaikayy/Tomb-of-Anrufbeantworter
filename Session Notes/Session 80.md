[[Delwyn]] goes towards the Graveyard, the [[Refuse Pit]] in the [[Old City]]
- Sees an elf putting on a mask coming out of a Ziggurat
	- he preaches to the "people of chult" about the "Cult of the devourer"
	- ![[masked elf.png]]
	- two burly dudes unmask him, take his amulet and throw him down the first flight of the Ziggurat into the trash piles
	- A new person emerges from the Ziggurat with defined muscles for his old age and talks about his stupid preaching being in common and no one speaking it ~_something like that_
- [[Delwyn]] runs after the elf and catches him as he is held up at the gate
	- he tries to overhear some words
		- Perception: 16
			- The Elf complains about just being robbed, the guards don't care about his ramblings
			- [[The Flaming Fist]] guards stop his entrance into the City and demand money for being let in
	- he pulls the Elf away from the guards and asks about his Cult
		- more doomer ramblings and offers to join the Cult
	- [[Delwyn]] asks for other names of the Elf's deity
		- Persuasion: 25
			- The Devourer's true name is "[[Acererak]] the Eternal", the most powerful being in all the realms
	- [[Delwyn]] shows his arm and asks if his god has something to do with this
		- The Elf hasn't seen something like this before but he deems it possible if not likely that [[Acererak]] has done this
	- [[Delwyn]] asks to talk to [[Acererak]]
		- Only the most worthy servants are able to talk to him themselves
	- [[Delwyn]] asks why they are practicing their religion here
		- Look at all this agony around here, I want to tell them all that their salvation will come and all of the suffering will end soon
	- [[Delwyn]] asks if they have some kind of Shrine here
		- Persuasion: 19
			- The Elf leads [[Delwyn]] away from most people and tells him that there is a little Shrine within the City, but it has to be kept secret because the guards have arrested some of their members recently
			- The Elf writes down the address to the Shrine at the Harbor
				- their meetings are held at the evening and [[Delwyn]] should be aware of the guards
- [[Delwyn]], Arcana: 17
	- As the elf leaves for the gate, the [[Shade Mark]] doesn't seem to respond to the situation

[[Delwyn]] continues on to the [[Refuse Pit]]
- the stench in indescribable
- inside the pit is scrambled furniture, cadaver of dinosaurs, humanoids and everything else imaginable
- there are ways to descent into the pit

[[Delwyn]] descents down into the Pit
- There is heaps of vermin down there feasting on the decomposing trash
- Perception: 8
	- There seem to be some alcoves to the side of the pit
- As he travels further...
