Recap - [[DM]]
We decide where to go and should get the sick somewhere first.
[[Kairi]] casts lesser restoration on herself, healing her [[paralyzed]] tongue, also healing [[Shadow]] in the process of her Beggar's Pox
The Soldiers of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] show us where to go.
We see Exotic Animals and Dinosaurs on sale in another direction.
We get to the Gate and see two kinds of Guards.
[[Fort Beluarian]] headquaters of [[The Flaming Fist]].
One [[The Flaming Fist]] Guard stands in our way, asking for our [[Rite for Exploration]].
Since we are with the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] we can go through this once.
We get to the Building and meet up with a member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]. We receive 50gp.
[[Kadrin]] asks for Paperwork, Member explains to us, that they are indeed scamming people with this but also it is legally required by the [[Trade Princes]]. 
[[Rite for Exploration]] costs 50gp.
If your Guide wants some of your Treasure it's a really shitty Guide.
We go towards the [[Temple of Savras]].
Banners are being hung up, it seems to be a festivity in some time, masks are handed out. [[Shadow]] asks [[Inete]] about it.
She says that the [[Grand Dino Races]] are soon. [[Trade Princes]] do a competition around the whole city to see who has the best Dinosaur Rider.
3 Races, bipedal, quadrupedal, all-in (everything allowed).
Entry fee is high, you'd need a dinosaur.
Smaller scale ones are everyday.
We see the [[Grand Coliseum]]. -> People fighting and killing each other, People, Dinosaurs, even Undead.
We arrive at the [[Temple of Savras]] and go in.
We are greeted by [[Zitembe]] and wave goodbye to [[Inete]].
We get a letter from [[Zitembe]] to bring to [[Zindar]] to pay our debt with the [[Ytepka Society]].
[[Dendar the Night Serpent]] is rumored to be sealed inside the [[Peaks of Flame]] volcano.
[[Gannin]] tells [[Zitembe]] about [[Inete]]'s mark.
[[Zitembe]] has a friend, who is a guide and could help us around the city. He gives us a posting of the Guide and says he could arrange a meeting with her.
[[Kairi]] uses Prestidigitation to make the party smell like flowers.
There is a Bathhouse in the [[Market Ward]], it is free unless you use other services.
[[Kadrin]] goes back in to talk to [[Zitembe]] again.
- Asks about her Sister, if he can search for her
- [[Kadrin]] describes his sister to him, similar to [[Kadrin]], longer browner hair
- There is a person with her, which would be more specific to describe
- There is a Saurian with them
- Just wants to make sure that she is fine
- [[Kadrin]] makes a vision of her Sister on the ground next to [[Zitembe]]
- [[Zitembe]] says, there are a lot of people / groups looking for her
- The [[Zhentarim]] are looking for her
- [[Zitembe]] can't locate them at all (somehow shielded)
- She is traveling with [[Artus Cimber]]
- [[Artus Cimber]] asked about the [[City of Mezro]] and if there was any way to bring it back (Former capital of [[Chult]])
- The City is an ancient ruin that has long fallen to the Spellplague
- [[Zitembe]] told [[Artus Cimber]] to seek Guidance in [[Orolunga]], there is a naga guardian of a ziggurat, said to have great amounts of wisdom, near the [[Mistcliff Mountains]]

[[Kairi]] helps out [[Gannin]] with the carrying weight casting Enhance Ability.
We go towards Harbormaster [[Zindar]].
We see a younger female Chultan lady, [[Zindar]] is in the back and we are being let in after talking about the letter from [[Zitembe]].
[[Gannin]] History.: 10
We give him the Letter and talks to a wire to the [[Ytepka Society]], that their services are no longer needed.
[[Kairi]] talks about [[The Flaming Fist]].
Either be part of a faction or get a pardon by [[Trade Princes]].
[[Shadow]] asks about the Pirates, we would have to hire a ship, Prices depends on the Captain hired.
We want to go to the Bathhouse and then eat something afterwards.
[[Kairi]] asks a Dinosaur Cart Rider to get us to the bathhouse, he declines, [[Kadrin]] tries to offer money but fails to.
[[Kairi]] Pers.: 24 - he takes us with him
We go into the Bathhouse, 1 Bath is nude (right), 1 Bath is clothed (left)
Washing Clothes is next door in clothing shops
Baths are open air and just one big pool
We decide to go next door to do laundry and buy a towel
[[Kadrin]] gives up his clothes to wash, uses Silent Image to hide his private parts with a hula skirt.
We go back to the bathhouse, towards the nude bath, more native chultan people here than the other bath.
There is a Servant going around offering soaps.
The water is nicely cool. Everyone exept [[Gannin]] is bathing.
[[Gannin]] tries to sneak out of the bath, Stealth: 17 - nobody notices
[[Kadrin]] pulls out [[Hubris]] and gets notified by the staff member that weapons aren't allowed in the pool.
[[Kairi]] & [[Shadow]] buy a bath soap for 5cp (Lotus, Banana or Coffee)

[[Gannin]] goes to the clothed bath , Perc.: 11 - [[Volothamp Geddarm]] is here, bathes there

[[Kadrin]] lays [[Hubris]] on the edge of the bath, [[Hubris]] is very amused.
[[Kairi]] goes outside to look for [[Gannin]].
[[Kairi]] casts Hideous Laughter on [[Gannin]], WIS SAV: 21. Puts his head underwater and resists the spell. [[Kairi]] leaves.
[[Kairi]] tries to wreak chaos in [[Gannin]]s backpack. She adds, 5 candles, 1 costume, fits the feathers she has to the backpack.

[[Shadow]] & [[Kadrin]] go for the saunas.
There are four wooden benches on the sides, in the middle is the infusion, there is a big golden dragonborn sitting there and two tabaxi side by side.
[[Shadow]] meets [[Soulblade]], mistakes him for [[Zindar]], his name originates from his Patron the [[Soul Warden]]. [[Shadow]] mentions [[Kadrin]] being a paladin initiate.
[[Kadrin]] introduces himself, [[Soulblade]] asks if the [[Hag'se Organization]] now has Paladins.
[[Kadrin]] is not associated with the [[Hag'se Organization]].
They both think they're the "true" or "only" Chosen One of the [[Soul Warden]].
[[Soulblade]] offers to settle this in the [[Grand Coliseum]].
[[Kadrin]] summons [[Hubris]], [[Soulblade]] is confused.
[[Soulblade]] has a Greatsword made of the same material as [[Hubris]]. He was part of a Tradeship that arrived in [[Port Nyanzaru]]. Their ship got sunk by Pirates outside of Port though.
[[Gannin]] walks over, [[Soulblade]] leaves. [[Gannin]] shakes his head and leaves back to the clothed bath again.
[[Shadow]] Insight: 19 - [[Soulblade]] was very convinced of himself, he seemed like he was playing a role though
[[Kadrin]] Inv.: 16 - [[Soulblade]] has left nothing behind but his soap.
All the while [[Kairi]] is playing with soap bubbles.
[[Gannin]] blatantly washes his shirt in the bath and gets asked to leave if he does that again, he leaves anyways.
[[Kairi]] donates 4gp.
[[Shadow]] donates 2gp 5sp.
[[Kadrin]] donates 2cp and complains about "the scum in here".
We get out of the bathhouse, get our clothes and go to [[Kaya's House of Repose]]. On our way we see clothes being inked and hung up over the shore.
[[Kairi]] plays some music for the busy tavern. Perf.: 27
[[Kadrin]] tries to get us rooms.
The tavern is packed and staff is not getting behind everything, the nearing [[Grand Dino Races]] seem to have a great impact on the Inn.
[[Kadrin]] pays 2gp for the 1gp room.
[[Shadow]] orders [[Amberfire]].
[[Gannin]] & [[Kadrin]] order [[Tej]] (local Honey Mead).
[[Kairi]] already got offered drinks.
[[Kadrin]] Pers.: 11 - to cook food in the kitchen
[[Gannin]] Pers.: 3 - to offer to help waitressing.
[[Kairi]] offers everyone a round of free drinks.
[[Jessamine]] does offer assassinations according to [[Jeffrey2]] in the Bar.
[[Kadrin]] VERY slowly starts growing a Mustache, [[Shadow]] tries to shave it off with a knife. [[Kadrin]] is apprehensive and backs off.
[[Kairi]] & [[Gannin]] go to get food in the [[Red Bazar]], while leaving the Inn,[[Gannin]] loudly screams out for a BAR FIGHT!
