Recap - [[Kadrin]]

## LONG REST - Day 2
Weather: Strong Rain, Normal Temp, Slight Wind

[[Kadrin]] tells [[Talsen]] about the [[Veil of Night]], which was identified by [[Wakanga O’tamu]] previously
- Wants to find out what it is or its origin
- Doesn't get any evil vibes from it but could be cursed given the origin
- [[Delwyn]] wants to investigate it further
	- Arcana: 13
		- Finds out its properties
	- He keeps it but doesn't use it for now

We clear up [[Kadrin]]'s situation from last night briefly

We all go out asking around for [[Musharib]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]]
- We take the mounts with us
- The Barkeep of [[The Thundering Lizard]] tells us that [[Musharib]] is staying at [[Kaya's House of Repose]]
	- We find [[Musharib]] in the Courtyard
	- We approach him and his eyes lock on [[Talsen]]
	- We tell him about our plan and the deviation for other quests we must do beforehand
		- [[Talsen]], Persuasion: 8
			- He wants to take the direct path
	- [[Kadrin]] tries to convince him again
		- Persuasion: 13
			- He will accompany us but
	- [[Musharib]] wants the up-front payment now and if we arrive at the  Mines he will give it back to us [[Hrakhamar]]
	- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense
		- nothing
	- We tell him we want to start traveling today
- [[Shadow]] sends a Note to [[Wakanga O’tamu]]
	- Says it's for requesting a magic item

We head out towards [[Vorn (Place)]]
- But before: [[Shadow]] refuses to ride with [[Delwyn]]
	- So Mount configuration is now:
		- [[Stomps]]: [[Kadrin]], [[Delwyn]]
		- Strider 1: [[Talsen]], [[Musharib]]
		- Strider 2: [[Shadow]], [[Shago]]
- As we Travel we get Information from our Guides
	- We should stay away from a Goblin Village if we come across it
		- According to legend they can fly like meteors
	- If we come across any Dinosaurs we should treat them with respect
		- They are the Children of [[Ubtao]]
		- They are revered by the followers of [[Thard Harr]]
- We see odd fruit dangling from trees in varying states of ripeness
	- We pick a few up
		- [[Kadrin]], Nature: 6
		- [[Shadow]], Nature: 23
			- Maracuja fruit, the brown and ripe ones treats ailments
				- The younger ones are highly toxic and can be deadly to consume
