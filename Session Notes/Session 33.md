 Recap - [[DM]]

_Another Notebook fades through the times and turn to dust, may it be picked up by someone else and continued to a Glory akin..._

- [[Miasma]] gets back out of the bag, soaking wet, turns back into herself
	- not salt water
-  [[Kadrin]] looks into the bag
	- sees darkness, not really getting brighter by the light spell
- [[Talsen]] fastens a rope to himself and tries to put his head into the bag
	- Perception: 8 - Not surface, nothing, just water
	- Pulls his head back out
- [[Kadrin]] and [[Talsen]] try to ascertain what the purpose of this bag is
	- [[Kadrin]], Arcana: 20
	- [[Talsen]], Arcana: [[Nat.20]] (26)
		- Was intended to transport things, very similar to a [[Bag of Holding]]
	- We take the bag with us

We go over into the room with the Archway
- [[Talsen]], Investigation: [[Nat.1]] (7)
	- There is a great maze carved into the ground, it seems to have already been solved
- [[Kadrin]] checks for invisible walls
	- Investigation: 18
		- No hidden walls
- [[Talsen]] tries to trace something into the maze, he rememberes from his vision
	- Nothing happens, it was on the pedestal
		- It has the same maze on it
		- ![[Maze of Ubtao.png]]
			- Traces it again
				- The sigils on the ground light up and a portal opens inside the archway
				- We see thick jungle with a circular path carved into it
				- [[Talsen]] says just to run through to find the [[Yuan-Ti]] or whatever it is they wanted in this Tomb

We all go through the portal as it fades behind us, we are surrounded on all sides by thick trees and dense foliage
- [[Shadow]] tries to climb out of this path, cutting through the lianas
	- suddenly she feels dizzy and everything turns as she falls through the roof
- A [[Chwinga]] appears out of the side of the trees, picks up a tree and goes back
	- [[Miasma]] follows it as a rat and comes back out of the other side again
- [[Talsen]] is very amazed by all of this 
- [[Kadrin]] tells [[Talsen]] about the [[Chwinga]]
- [[Talsen]] starts taking notes about this place
- We hear waterfalls in the distance and tropical birds just like in the Jungle

We follow more corridors turning corners left and right
- [[Kadrin]] summons the illusion of a Dodo Bird to see if we meet it again in the next 10 minutes and are running in circles
	- After another 10 Minutes we don't find the illusion
	- Another 10 Minutes go by and nothing happens
- After about an hour we sit down to eat something
	- A green portal opens up before us  leading into [[Miasma]]'s room

We go through the Portal and find ourselves in [[Hisari]]
- There is no portal behind us as we enter the room
- A [[Thorny]] comes to the door and [[Miasma]] greets it
	- [[Kadrin]] casts Speak with Animals to communicate with it
		- Doesn't seem to work
- Soon after a [[Vegepygme]] enters after it
- The party is very confused that or if these are friends in any way
- [[Miasma]] talks to the [[Vegepygme]]
	- There seems to have been problems with undead in the crater

As [[Talsen]] studies his notes, [[Vegepygme]] and the rest of the party go outside and explain everything around this place
- There was lots of fighting and some of the [[Vegepygme]] and [[Thorny]] lie [[dead]] on the ground
- [[Talsen]] INT: 16
	- Copies an approximate Path seen in the [[Tomb of Kahuli]]
	- Seems like an Address to be put into the pedestal on where to go
- [[Talsen]] Survival: 20
	- The path we took in the jungle path does not look like the same path drawn on the maze
---
- [[Kadrin]] asks [[Miasma]] if the [[Vegepygme]] are undead
	- "No, these are shrooms."
		- [[Kadrin]] Insight: 3
			- [[Miasma]] is very hard to read
- [[Shadow]] relays [[Talsen]]'s information about the Artifact and Hole back to [[Kadrin]]
	- [[Kadrin]] is eager to go down there and kill the Undead [[Yuan-Ti]]
- The supposed Leader of the [[Vegepygme]] talks to [[Miasma]]
	- They go inside her house to talk, the party follows
- [[Miasma]] says: "Things have gotten worse, Undead have been climbing out more and more, many neighbours [[dead]], I need to stay, I need to defend."
---
- [[Talsen]] takes some more time to see how this portal network works
	- There seem to be 6 openings in the Maze
	- Maze in [[Hisari]]:
	- ![[Maze in Hisari.png]]
	- Maze in [[Tomb of Kahuli]]:
	- ![[Maze in Tomb of Kahuli.png]]
- [[Talsen]] writes the Address of [[Hisari]] in the Pedestal in [[Hisari]] to confirm his theory
	- A Portal opens and we go through to find another pathway shrouded in thick jungle
	- [[Kadrin]] plays the Drums as he sees a [[Chwinga]]
		- Performance: 11 - he seems amused
- We try out if we can make it under an hour if we run and test the timing with a Disguise Self from [[Shadow]]
	- We run for an hour, Athletics
		- [[Talsen]]: 23
		- [[Kadrin]]: 7
		- [[Shadow]]: 21
	- [[Kadrin]] is way slower and still makes it in exactly and hour as a portal opens before him far behind [[Talsen]] and [[Shadow]]
	- [[Kadrin]] is fed up and leaves the building, stating that he wants to fight something, sleep or eat
		- looks for stray undead or something eatable
			- he sees a slain beast in the window, covered in mycelium and a [[Thorny]] emerging from it as other [[Vegepygme]] hold their hands over it
		- [[Shadow]] follows him
			- They talk about the village, plans for the future and if following [[Talsen]] and the Artifact is helpful for their greater plans

##### SHORT REST ([[Talsen]])
The party reconvenes with [[Talsen]] and ask for the best place to take a rest and where to go next
- [[Shadow]] wants to go to [[Kir Sabal]] because [[Gannin]] wanted to see it and the Aarakocra might be able to help
- [[Kadrin]] asks if [[Talsen]] knows [[Artus Cimber]]
	- History: 10
- We discuss where to go while [[Talsen]] explains to the others how the [[Webway of Ubtao]] works to his knowledge


---
Plan:
- Go to [[Port Nyanzaru]]
	- Ask [[Zitembe]] where [[Bolnir Copperhandle]] is
- Go back to [[Hisari]] via the [[Webway of Ubtao]]
- Travel to [[Omu]] 
	- to get more information and scout out the area
