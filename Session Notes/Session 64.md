###### Delwyn's Vision/Dream
- [[Delwyn]] wakes up with a piece of cloth on his face, as he puts it down he sees that the tent he was in before is rotten through and through. The Grass around him has turned to desolate wasteland. Beside him is a skeleton of a dwarf. As he goes out to see the other tent, it is also rotten and bones are peaking out. Outside are more skeletons at the campfire that died long ago. The trees, the flora and fauna, everything has wasted away only leaving behind a web of dead wood and scrub.
	- He is in the [[Shadowfell]] but something is different, the [[Veil of Night]] makes a comforting, familiar blue light on the ground and shining stars in the sky.
	- A bit farther from the camp, he sees a woman floating turned with her back to him, crying, face tucked in her hands. Only one half of her is physical and this half is being pulled into the other half which seem ethereal.
	- [[Delwyn]] speaks to her as he knows this silhouette as his mother.
	- She says that she is sorry and that he has to find "them"
		- He has to find the "Aspects" and has to kill them all
		- She tries to grab him but can't as her personality shifts angrier and reverts back quickly
		- She tells him, that before he met his father, she had nothing and was living on the street, having lost everything.
		- "She" (her other self) brought her to his father and was her only point of contact.
		- He has to find the [[Aspects of Ubtao]] and kill them all
		- [[Delwyn]] asks where he can find the Aspects
		- "She" has absorbed [[Ubtao]]'s Shadow and wants to kill his aspects now
		- [[Delwyn]] promises that he will do everything in his power to help her
		- She says to hurry and he goes in for a hug. But as he reaches out with his right hand, where he does not wear his ring, the hand,  then arm begins hurt more and more and starts withering away.
		- The pain seizes his vision and makes him loose his dream to wake up on the next day
