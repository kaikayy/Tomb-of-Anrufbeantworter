[[Delwyn]] tells us about his hand but not the story behind it, tells us it is probably an effect of the [[Veil of Night]]
- [[Talsen]] suggests cutting the hand off before it spreads or he might lose his life
- [[Delwyn]] declines and would rather keep his hand, [[Kadrin]] says that he will see that it doesn't get worse
- [[Musharib]] seems lost in thought during this whole conversation

We continue to travel closer to the [[Mistcliff Mountains]] towards [[Orolunga]]
