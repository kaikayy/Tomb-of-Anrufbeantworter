#### LONG REST -> Day 7
Weather: Strong Wind, Normal Temp, No Rain
[[Kadrin]] cooks, DEX: 13 - "Regular Kebab"

[[Delwyn]] tells us about his hand but not the story behind it, tells us it is probably an effect of the [[Veil of Night]]
- [[Talsen]] suggests cutting the hand off before it spreads or he might lose his life
- [[Delwyn]] declines and would rather keep his hand, [[Kadrin]] says that he will see that it doesn't get worse
- [[Musharib]] seems lost in thought during this whole conversation

We continue to travel closer to the [[Mistcliff Mountains]] towards [[Orolunga]]

Along our travels...
- We find [[Copacou]] fruit, with a hard brown shell and a quickly melting chocolaty interior
- [[Delwyn]] finds an engraving in a tree "[[Bravus Boulderhorn]] was here"
	- History:
		- [[Shadow]]: Nat.20 (22)
		- [[Kadrin]]: 4
		- [[Delwyn]]: 6
		- [[Talsen]]: 21
			- [[Talsen]] has heard the name a few months back in [[Port Nyanzaru]]. He was a dwarf and part of a group of adventurers who set out for the jungle. They where carrying a yellow standard with them everywhere.
	- [[Shadow]] looks around if she can find anything
		- Investigation: 17
			- Nothing buried in the dirt or footsteps around
- The jungle before us is frozen solid, ice spikes hand from leaves, snow is falling lightly and covers the whole ground
	- [[Kadrin]] remembers that [[Xandala]] left [[Bolnir Copperhandle]]'s group at a point described like this
	- [[Kadrin]] takes a look around
		- Perception: 4
			- sees a clearing up ahead inside the snow
	- [[Talsen]] drops backwards into the snow and ignites his weapon to not freeze to death
	- [[Kadrin]] casts speak with animals to try to convince [[Stomps]] to go into the snow
		- Persuasion: 19
			- He can convince him and [[Stomps]] shivers and runs back into the warmth
				- Nature: 11 - The Environment could probably harm [[Stomps]]
	- [[Shadow]] looks for anything inside the area
		- Perception: 21
			- Sees that the snow area seems circular, in the center is a clearing and something is standing in the clearing
	- [[Musharib]] says something about twisted nature spirits while [[Shago]] discovers the fun to be had with snow

We go into the Snow covered area without the mounts, [[Musharib]] and [[Shago]]

- Heading towards the clearing in the middle we see multiple small ponds, frozen over and a humanoid looking Ice-figure in the middle of them, her hand reaching out towards one side
	- [[Kadrin]] casts Divine Sense and steps closer
		- can't sense any presence but sees a small ball of red scales, a pseudo drake curled into a ball, it is [[Xandala]]'s dragon, [[Summerwise]]
	- [[Talsen]] enters [[Vorn]] and does the same
	- As we go closer, we see indeed [[Xandala]]'s body made out of ice, translucent
	- [[Summerwise]] looks at us with sad eyes, shivering
		- [[Shadow]] offers a Ration to it
			- Persuasion: 17
				- It nibbles on it a bit
	- We all hear a loud cracking as the ice around us bursts upward and forms into creatures
	- ### [[Fight_S65]]
