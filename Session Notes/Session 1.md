###### Raw Text



We are at the Manor of [[Syndra Sylvane]]. She wants to hold up the [[Death Curse]].

We see two characters before the Mansion.

Dir Tür wird von [[Charles Bunsworth]], dem Butler geöffnet, [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] und [[Kairi]] stellen sich vor und werden hineingelassen.
[[Kairi]] plays Harp Performance: 22

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] holt eine Trommel heraus, Performance: 20

Bunsworth lässt die beiden im nächsten Raum warten. Hier sitzen 3 Personen.

Giant greetings, hugs [[Kairi]]. [[Gannin|Gannin]] introduces [[Shadow]]. [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] introduces himself.

Insight: 24 - [[Gannin|Gannin]] -> [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] - He dumb or at least doesn't know magic

[[Shadow]] comes from another Continent - Histoy ([[Kairi]]) 15

[[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo]] is a friend of Lady [[Syndra Sylvane]] and wants to write a book about [[Chult]].

[[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo]] has set his People up for investigating the Red from [[Thay]].

The Lady isn't very well right now so we go to see her for a briefing.

We see Lady [[Syndra Sylvane]] and she is huddled up in Pillows and Blankets, sitting near a fire place, hood up in a silver mask.

She is an archmage and successful merchant. Made a living off of trading, Used to be an adventurer.

Was resurrected. Afflicted by the [[Death Curse]] and doesn't know how much longer she has.

[[Harpers]] say, [[Death Curse]] originates from [[Chult]] and an Artifact called the Soul Monger.

Seems to suck up any soul that is released from their body.

She prepared some Supplies for the party. Will reward us with treasure after we succeed.

We all get 50gp/each and 2 Maps. One of [[Port Nyanzaru]]. One of [[Chult]].

Contact Merchant Prince [[Wakanga O’tamu]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] for Magical goods. [[Syndra Sylvane]] will be staying with him.

Be very careful with the Map of [[Chult]], it's one of a kind. Most of the Jungle is blanked out and unexplored.

We are officially in her Name and her Expedition there, We are THE LAST RESORT.

We should get Food and Water, Insect Repellant and hire a guide who leads expeditions.

Insect can be diseased.

We reconviene in the Foyer, After discussing what teleportation is. We meet [[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo]] again.

We are ready to depart. [[Syndra Sylvane]] leaves the Mansion to Bunsworth.

We are being teleported and are surrounded by a bright light.

We appear in a tropical city in the braising sun. We hear a lot of voices in unknown languages filled with klicks and singsong words. We smell mysterious spices. The buildings are colorful beyond believe. The whole city is bustling.

The Language is Chultan.

We see a giant Lizard who is pulling a ship, someone is riding it. It's a dinosaur. A giant Statue of a Warrior in the Sea with Feather Armor. We see a lot of strange and unfamiliar creatures.

If we need some rest go to these locations.

We need to find a guide and get some Equipment. [[Syndra Sylvane]] and [[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo]] leave. [[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo]] is at [[Kaya's House of Repose]].

We see a Mynstral playing and some harbor workers. [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] cries out to the birds and asks for a guide or a dragon turtle. He continues to speak with the birds and seems to hear them.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] speaks in Bird and has learned it from the birds.

[[Shadow]] goes bathing in the ocean (10 (D20 roll))

[[Kairi]] goes to perform with the Mynstral (Tabaxi), he has Leopard fur and has fine clothes.

They make a bet for 10g each for who plays better, if [[Kairi]] wins he tells her where he got his clothes from. There is a small crowd.

[[Kairi]] - 18, Mynstral - ??

[[Kairi]] wins and takes the now 20gp. For the clothes she has to check out the Dye Works in the [[Market Ward]].

I go to one of the Harbor Workers and ask where to find Equipment, they speak common.

Try one of the Bazars ([[Red Bazar]]) for Equipment. It is in the [[Market Ward]]. The waters contain sharks.

[[Shadow]] schaut ins Wasser und sieht keine Sharks.

I look at the map for the [[Market Ward]].

Religion Check (20) for [[Kadrin|Kadrin]]s hair, Gods sometimes choose people to which makes their bodyparts glow.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] is an Aasimar and doesn't know it, he thinks he's a human.

[[Kairi]] ist hier mit ihrer Kleidung mal nicht, das Center of Attention.

Es gibt viele Hohe Mauern in der Stadt aber alle sind geschmückt mit Pflanzen und Murals of Lizards or Heroes.

[[Gannin|Gannin]] Insight Check (10) to see if the Dinosaurs are hostile to petting.

[[Kairi]] wants to pet a dinosaur, grapple check ([[Gannin|Gannin]]: Athletics 10, [[Kairi]]: Acrobatics 17)

Driver of the Dino cart doesn't want our apology and [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] speaks with the Dino.

[[Kairi]] Pets the Dino (AH: 13) he likes it. I slap the Dino to go (AH: 12) he goes slowly.

Wir gehen weiter und kommen an ein riesiges Zelt wo viele Leute Waren verkaufen.

We go into the big tent, we buy cooking utensils, calligraphers supplies, thieves tools, colorful scaly hide armor (green with red stripes), fitting clothing for the town, a Longsword, a decorated Shield.

Big Tent is the [[Grand Souk]]. Ivory Statues are sold here cut from the big reptilian bones.

I go to a Merchant that sells Masks, he doesn't know anything about Goblins or their ecology.

[[Batiri]] Masks from Goblin Tribes in the Jungle. ([[Nat.1]] Investigation for searching if the Masks are stolen)

I buy a mask with many feathers for 10gp.

Rest of the party looks at the exotic pet shop and see many weird and interesting creatures in cages.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] spricht mit dem Lizard (Komodo Dragon) and he wants to be left alone. Which he assumes is his name.

I try to turn away the merchant of the exotic pets (Deception: 13), Sleight of Hand ([[Kairi]]: 17, [[Shadow]]: 27)

I go in the opposite Direction with the merchant. All the animals slowly escape.

AH to convince the comodo Dragon 18 ([[Kadrin|Kadrin]] adv. T. [[Kairi]])

[[Shadow]] casts speak with animals to convince the comodo dragon. (AH. 13 adv. T. [[Kadrin|Kadrin]])

I bolt into the opposite direction as i end the conversation.

Pick up the others and run with them out of the tent. [[Kairi]]: 9 [[Kadrin|Kadrin]]: 19 Str. Checks

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] calls the Komodo [[Crystal (Lizard)]].

We go south neigbouring a great wall and some nice looking buildings.

We get to another market. This is a part of the [[Red Bazar]], we find Food and Insect Repellant.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] buys food for 5 days for the party consisting of mostly fruit and vegetables.

There seem to be 2 variaties of [[Guards of Port Nyanzaru|Guards]], Chultan [[Guards of Port Nyanzaru|Guards]] with Scaly Hide, Yklwas and wooden shields and some Fully Plated [[Guards of Port Nyanzaru|Guards]] nearly choking in the sun. -> They bear an emblem of a Fist that is in Flames. They have different races and skincolors and wear not only full plate but also "normal" leather armor.

We go to the [[Red Bazar]]. We see a gargantuan Building, the Dome of which is made of Gold and it seems to house some important people or the government.

Carrying [[Crystal (Lizard)]]: [[Kairi]] [[Nat.20]], [[Kadrin|Kadrin]]: 9; [[Kairi]]: 15,[[Kadrin|Kadrin]]: 9

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] tries to persuade [[Crystal (Lizard)]] (20), it stops trying to escape.

I ask someone what that gargantuan building is, it's the [[Hall of Gold]], temple of waukeen.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] talks to the elder man about the Soulwarden and wants to know about temples.

I go towards the [[Red Bazar]]. [[Kairi]] drags [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] away. We see the [[Red Bazar]], there is much meat sold here, some vegetables. I see a merchant who has build up some racks of wooden logs for Raincatchers. I buy one. We each buy another Waterskin. [[Kairi]] buys 5 Rations so everybody has 10.

We decide to go to a Tavern to find a local guide. [[The Thundering Lizard]].

Religiion Check for the Soulwarden (19) - Is a far spread Religion, even in [[Thay]], seen often in my Travels, often Associated with the Hug'se Organisation. Sells many different Items and promises if they buy something the [[Soul Warden]] will watch over them. Also called "The Soul Scourge" mockingly by other religions, it's seen as a sales scam. Symbol: Hooded Figure with Angel wings, cannot see the face.

I try to tie Rope around [[Crystal (Lizard)]] (AH: 10) it tries to hit me, 8 to hit, no hit. It doesn't wanna get tied up.

We enter the bar, it's a little worse for wear and a Bard is playing. There are some lightly clothed women that are flirting with some patrons.

I put the Lizard into one of my deeper Side bags, taking it from [[Kadrin|Kadrin]]. (AH: 18)

[[Shadow]] gets a waitress, do they have a menu, some food or drink? They hand us a menu.

[[Kairi]], [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] & I buy local food, [[Shadow]] buys a fruit platter with ale.

We get a platter with Steak of wich we don't recognize the meat. (1sp each)

[[Kairi]] tells me about getting her new name. I tell about the connection with [[Kairi]]. [[Shadow]] tells about how her and I met. [[Kairi]] is still no fighter, [[Shadow]] is a very skilled fighter. [[Kadrin|Kadrin]] casts Light on [[Shadow]]s Clothes.

The meat tastes like chicken. I go to the Barkeep "[[Bunn Dodoth]]", there are Guide Jobs postet at the Job board, i order another round of ale for the table and go look at the job board.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] is lost in thought looking at the loosely dressed ladies in the bar, [[Kairi]] talks to the Barkeep, [[Kairi]] orderes two rooms for the party for (org. 4sp), [[Kairi]] offers to Sing and Dance here for the night for free rooms (Persuasion: 15), she declines. [[Kairi]] starts Singing and Playing on her Lyre (Perf. 20), it drags some attention from the barkeep and patrons.

[[Kadrin|Kadrin]] tries to play the drums and get into [[Kairi]]s Rythm (Perf. 16), he does a good job at it.

There are Wanted Posters of three [[Pirate Captains]], 500gp per capita. 2000gp for capturing the ship too.
