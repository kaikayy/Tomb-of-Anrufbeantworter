Recap - [[Kadrin]]

As we are climbing up the vine, the whole Temple crumbles below us and we now stand among the [[Vegepygme]] and [[Miasma]].
We tell [[Miasma]] that we did it and she promises to rebuild the parts of the village that collapsed
[[Kadrin]] slowly grows accustom to the [[Vegepygme]] after they saved his life in the temple
The Chieftain of the [[Vegepygme]] brings us a chest containing:
- 800 gp 
- Black Pearl (700 gp)
- Rose Quartz (50 gp)
- Potion of Remove Paralysis (300 gp)
[[Talsen]] shovels it all into the [[Bag of Holding]]
[[Kadrin]] shows the [[Longsword of Purging]] to [[Miasma]]
- She doesn't know what it is
- The Chieftain doesn't know either
- [[Kadrin]] notices a symbol of [[Ubtao]] on the [[Longsword of Purging]]

[[Talsen]]'s Head hurts again and he get's another Vision
- Again in the Pool of Blood
- Sees [[Ssaztehsi]] and only him
- [[The Eye of Sseth]] and also the Chamber are still intact despite the collapse
- The Voices will subside in time but there are some who want to say goodbye
- 6 dwarven figures rise out of the blood
	- "You fucking did it Hammerstone, you crazy dwarf"
	- They all go in for a group hug
- They tell him that they're just copies or images of the actual former crew
- They have prepared something for [[Talsen]], a little bit of Dwarven touch for his [[Yuan-Ti]] Blood Magic
	- All step back and all rise a bit of blood up from in front of them, it rushes towards [[Talsen]], the Shield glows and is squeaky clean
- [[Talsen]] receives [[Hammer's Bulwark of Golden Stout]]
	- They explain the features of the Shield

- They ask him to keep them in mind
- They request something
	- Their Souls didn't go where they were supposed to
	- It's most probably the [[Soulmongerer]]
- They cheers and say their final goodbyes to [[Talsen]] as they sink back into the blood
- [[Ssaztehsi]] gives me a warning about [[Omu]] and the former wielder of the [[Longsword of Purging]] 
	- A long time a go a human paladin joined the [[Yuan-Ti]] and was transformed
	- He offered [[Ssaztehsi]] his sword, no one had any

	- [[Ssaztehsi]] created [[The Hissing]] as an Avatar of his God [[Sseth]] to oppose the powers of him and prove that it's wrong to worship [[Dendar the Night Serpent]]
	- He is [[Ras Nsi]]
- [[Talsen]] asks if [[Ubtao]] is a good god for other creatures
	- [[Ssaztehsi]] doesn't really want to answer but he heard that [[Ubtao]] died and it isn't worth worshipping a dead god
- [[Talsen]] asks [[Ssaztehsi]] to keep their connection up... for now
- [[Ssaztehsi]] wants to give [[Talsen]] a gift as well, a transformation ritual to a [[Yuan-Ti]]
	- Cut out a humanoid heart, devour the heart, plunge yourself into the Big Snake pit in [[Omu]]
	- It is a very straining ritual and you will feel weak or weird afterward for a while
	- The transformation is permanent and irreversible

	- Gives out a Goodberry to [[Talsen]] and eats one herself, both heal for 1 HP

After 20 minutes inside the [[Webway of Ubtao]] we notice something akin to a room or an opening up ahead to our left

	- [[Shadow]]: 30
	- [[Kadrin]]: 
	- [[Talsen]]: 6

We arrive at the edges of [[Port Nyanzaru]] as the sun goes down and gather up in [[Talsen]]'s Shack

We decide to take Watches to the grudge of [[Talsen]] as he puts a chair against the door

1. Watch - [[Kadrin]]
Perc.: 
Casts Armor of Agathys on himself
Takes a closer look at the [[Longsword of Purging]], laying [[Hubris]] beside it
Religion: 19
Feels like it is imbued with a Holy Spirit but it doesn't seem to be able to communicate like [[Hubris]] can. The Holy Symbol of [[Ubtao]] is prevalent on the Hilt. It seems to demand some dedication and can be used a new Hexblade Weapon if he is willing to make a pact with it.
He asks [[Hubris]] if he's ever seen something like this before, [[Hubris]] says only similar things with high ranking paladins
He is unsure if he can make that decision now, pointing our [[Hubris]] as selfish but also useful to him to fight and that he did good with his selfish actions too
He doesn't want to lose or replace [[Hubris]] and thinks that he deserves his body back by now
He says [[Hubris]] is his mentor as [[Hubris]] is surprised that he didn't leave him behind already
He believes everything deserves a second chance and he has to do the right thing to help [[Hubris]]
He doesn't want to hurt people with [[Hubris]] though, as [[Zaranite]] should never be used to touch a person especially as their dying. But he can use [[Hubris]] as a mentor by his side while using the [[Longsword of Purging]] to do his fighting.
[[Hubris]] is understanding of his reasoning and glad that he didn't abandoned him.
[[Hubris]] points out the deal he made with the [[Soul Warden]] to get his body back
He suggests just asking the [[Soul Warden]]  but his magical power is used up for today.
He feels like he is on the right track and he shouldn't aspire to just get this light back as he believes he got some of it back and this middle path is really working out right now.
He wants to help people and bring light to his companions and wants to have the ability to save all of them. He believes he needs this light for that.
He suggests to work together for his goal and form an alliance with [[Hubris]] and whoever might be in his dreams or in the stars. [[Hubris]] agrees to this.
He assures himself that [[Hubris]] won't leave when he takes on this new Sword and new Pact. [[Hubris]] answers that the [[Soul Warden]] can whisk him away at any second and he doesn't know what will happen.
He says [[Hubris]] to tell the [[Soul Warden]] that he is searching for the light and will get it.
The [[Longsword of Purging]] is now [[Kadrin]]'s new Hexblade as he dreams of a darkness again but a burning light blinds him as he wakes up.
