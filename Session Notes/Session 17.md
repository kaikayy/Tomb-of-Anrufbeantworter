### LONG REST
---
[[Kadrin]] Dream:
Sitting at a table with cookies and the [[Soul Warden]]. 
Asks how he is?
Didn't we meet a couple days ago, is everything alright, Persuasion: 21
She had a few intruders in her domain, but nothing to worry about
Did they want the cookies?
I doubt it
What kind of intruders, undead?
I am not sure, all of my servants didn't make it.
This is worrying
Nothing you have to worry about, [[Kadrin]]
Not yet
That said, she might be a bit preoccupied in the following times. She wants to teach [[Kadrin]] some abilites before that.
So we wont be able to talk like this
Not like this but there will be another way. ... We are gonna combine you shooting lazers and hitting with your sword. would you summon [[hubris]] for me please?
([[Hubris]] yellow pearls are greay and he doesn't talk)
[[Hubris]], wake up, the [[Soul Warden]] wants to talk to you
Actually i don't, he's not here right now. we'll just need the sword for this. Focus on your Sword while summoning a lazer.
(The Energy of Eldritch Blasts stays on the Sword and is released with a strike)
SW: Furthermore, there is another way to contact me, just channel your power into a piece of Seronite, just as the material your sword is made out of. You'll also needa holy symbol of any other diety.
Why another diety?
I just like... company i guess
As a god i of course also like offerings, so you should bring something that i can enjoy myself with, some substance i can consume like drinks. (or drugs)
Just put it on the Sword/Holy Symbol, got it.
So, i believe that is everything i wanted to teach you, i guess we weill not be seeing each other as often.
That's sad but i guess you're occupied otherwise. One last question, do you talk to that [[Soulblade]]?
I don't know anyone by the name or description.
Just another reason to strike him down
([[Kadrin]] takes a cookie and he passes out)

We go to eat breakfast and discuss what to do next.
[[Kadrin]]'s Fight was at dawn, since it's after dawn we head to the [[Grand Coliseum]]
Seems to be a small market  under the Arena's Ranks
[[Kadrin]] looks for [[Soulblade]], Perc.: 1
We ask for Rules and [[Soulblade]], the fight is paid for  by the Trade Princess of the arena ([[Ekene-Afa]]).
We fill out the paperwork for us to be announced and have an hour to prepare before the fight.
[[Shadow]], Perception: 19 - finds what she is looking for but it's too expensive atm
We look around the market for a while and find an Orphan selling [[Soulblade]] and other action figures of well known fighters. [[Kadrin]] insults the Kid and wnat's to kill [[Soulblade]]. [[Gannin]] asks the Kid about [[Soulblade]], he helps out at the Orphanage, his coolest move is him breathing fire.
We get to the arena grounds.
We see many people watching, on a bigger rank we see [[Ekene-Afa]], a white haired elf, adorned with shirtless guards and statues.
The Elf is the announcer named [[Herald]].
We are fighting:
[[Soulblade]]
[[Beggar Prince Kahuli]] (2566gp debt to the arena)
FÃ¼rst [[Troy]] (Noble from [[Baldur's Gate]])
