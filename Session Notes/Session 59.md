		- [[Kadrin]] asks for food preferences and [[Delwyn]] says that he will keep an eye out for any [[Yuan-Ti]], he also has learned to eat anything as he experiences hard times before
	- [[Wakanga O’tamu]] says that the Sword is quite Ancient and was created in the [[City of Mezro]], it has a powerful enchantment on it which seems to have been desecrated in a sense. It seems to have a mind of it own and was designed to destroy evil and judge the soul around it. It rewards those who follow it's path; it can grant you abilities or further your strength. It has a connection to [[Ubtao]]. It can be repaired but he's not sure how, the damage doesn't seem of arcane nature. Someone might know how to restore it to it's former power or glory. Using it to it's purpose might be the thing that ultimately is able to restore it. It's former wielder had used it to other means and seemed to taint it's power.
	  Also the Gold Plating on the Sword is just that, plating. The Blade is made from steel but the plating will never wear off thanks to its enchantment.

	- [[Wakanga O’tamu]] says that it is a cloak which grants some unique abilities when attuned
		- It provides an illusionary disguise once per day, which last indefinitely if you do not dismiss it
		- It shields you from sunlight, helping you not be blinded or burned by it
		- It makes everything look like eternal night, but you also cannot see light emitting from anything but the moon it produces
	- [[Kadrin]] tells [[Wakanga O’tamu]] about out encounter with [[Acererak]]
		- Persuasion: 21
		- [[Wakanga O’tamu]] says that he might do something worse than just walking into the city if it was him. He talked a lot to [[Syndra Sylvane]] about him and judges him smarter than that.
	- [[Wakanga O’tamu]] offers to buy it from us as he finds it to be really beautiful
		- [[Kadrin]] declines to find out more of its connection to evil
