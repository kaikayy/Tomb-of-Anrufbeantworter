Recap - [[Talsen]]

[[Kadrin]]'s hair glows even more brightly than before.

[[Eku]] says that unless reaching the end you cannot die in the maze, if anything else kills you in there, either nothing happens or one is just thrown out of the maze

[[Shago]] goes to sit on the mat, while [[Kadrin]] takes a moment to breathe and [[Talsen]] organizes his bag

The Maze glows white and [[Shago]] says that he is not really afraid of the undead and turning into one anymore.

[[Shadow]] sits down to meditate
- _As you open your eyes, you find yourself surrounded by walls to both of your sides with a confused Summerwise standing next to you. In front of you is a path forward. However as you look back, you hear a voice: "Shadow my dear, you will never escape me!". As Skaldric's voice echoes off of the walls. The path behind you begins to colapse!_
- [[Summerwise]] is there too
- [[Skaldric]]'s voice echoes from behind her and the path behind her collapses
- she runs forward, picks up [[Summerwise]]
- _The maze before you disapears to reveal the chamber from your vision once more. You see the prince, his advisor and Acererrak talking to each other, but you do not hear their words. Instead you hear an unfamiliar voice of a woman in your head:_
	- _"After the Kings death, the prince of Maztica was so blinded by his lust for vengence that he let the Lich's promises poison his mind. So much so that even his advisor could not convince him to save his crumbling empire or to return home to his family, his wife and their child, your grandfather."_
- tries to cut the whip with a dagger
- another rope snaps out to capture [[Summerwise]]
	- she tries cutting the rope, but can't quite reach it
- An [[Almiraj]] appears and asks to be summoned by [[Shadow]]
	- she transfers energy into the [[Almiraj]] that then transfers its energy into [[Summerwise]], who can now cut the rope itself
- They are able to move again and do so
- _As you run through the maze, you run out onto a street which looks like the ones you saw in Omu but the buildings surrounding it aren't yet ruins instead they are on fire! You are suddently surrounded by poeple fighting each other: Chultan Humans in jewel studded armor are fighting Tabaxi, Minotaurs are cleaving though zombies with their great axes and winged demons and gargoyles are picking poeple up from the ground and dropping them from up high. In this totally chaos, all sound of fighting suddently goes deaf and you hear the unfamiliar voice once more:_
	- _"The battle between the Mazticans and the Omuans would have been a quick victory for the Omuans, if it hadn't been for Acererark's "aid". Instead it turned into a day long blood bath on both the side of the Omuans and the Mazticans, YOUR poeple."_
	- Perception: 26, tries to recognize the voice
		- The voice seems unnatural, it is telepathy
- chains rattle and the street under her crumbles, as a whip comes out of the ground, she tries to dodge it
	- DEX SAV: 13
		- 7 DMG
- A [[Zorbo]] appears and askes to be summoned
	- she does and again empowers [[Summerwise]] intercepting the next metal whip hit
- they continue on
- _As you run you are suddently see a wooden staircase. With the ground falling behind you, you have no choice but to run up. When you arrive on top you are not greeted with a view of the maze but instead a crowd of poeple in chains. Behind them you see the city of Omu in ruins after the battle. Gargoyles are Perched on the roof tops and undead keep the crowd in place to witness what is happening on the stage that you have just stepped on. Standing in the middle you see Acererak speaking to the crowd while prince Umbra and a chained-up chultan woman dressed like a queen stand silently with their heads held low behind him. Then the voice begins to speak in your head again:_
	- _"After the blood bath, both queen Napaka and prince Umbra had to kneel before the Lich to save what little remained of their poeple. On this stage Acererak revealed to them that it was him who had poisoned and stolen the body of the Maztican King. He then forced both the Mazticans and the Omuans to build a tomb for the nine gods he slew that day. Those who didn't die during its construction were later used to test its deadly traps. In the end none were left alive."_
- A shadowy version of [[Skaldric]] appears behind her and snatches [[Summerwise]]
- Another animal spirit appears and asks to be summoned
	- she does so and it empowers [[Summerwise]] to free itself from [[Skaldric]]
- [[Shadow]] takes the whip out of [[Skaldric]]'s hand, slings it around his neck and slowly suffocates him with it
	- 26 to hit
	- [[Skaldric]]'s body stops breathing and crumbles into nothingness, leaving only a blackened snake lunging at [[Shadow]]
- her vision goes black
- in the vision of a snake it attacks a person with the lower half body of a snake
- she regains her own vision, standing on a pillar with a giant snake wrapped around it, [[Dendar the Night Serpent]] looks directly at her
- ![[Pasted image 20240527194125.png]]
- They converse
- despite my name things will flourish in the light and not in the shadows
- D: You are the rightful heir to [[Maztica]] and [[Acererak]] took that from you, the Tomb you are about to enter was built on the bodies of your people. If it weren't for [[Acererak]]'s actions you would be sitting on a throne not running around in a humid jungle. Do you not wich to take Vengeance on him?
- S: We will kill [[Acererak]]. But i don't think it will be out of vengeance, but neccassity.
- D: The vision i gave you is a direct way to [[Ras Nsi]] in the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]]. He is one of [[Acererak]]'s minions.
- S: Isn't [[Ras Nsi]] on your side?
- D: He has been mislead by [[Acererak]], his main goal is no longer to release me, so I wish him gone.
- S: So you need my help with that? Why should I do things that you want? I don't think the night is for me.
- D: You could of course ignore him and dismiss the sacrifice of your own people.
- _The darkness around Shadow grows tighter and more uncomfortable as she awakens back in the meditation chamber._

Bright green energy emerges from the Maze and
