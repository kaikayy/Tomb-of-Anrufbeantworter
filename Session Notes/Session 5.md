We ask [[Inete]] what this is, It's the [[House of the Man and the Crocodile]], a statue depicting an old well-known chultan fairy tail -->

In the early days of the world, Man stood by the banks of a river, [[frightened]]. Crocodile raised his head from the water and asked, “What troubles you, cousin Man?” Man said, “I must cross this river, but I fear to enter the water alone, because it teems with your brethren.” Crocodile replied, “It’s true, you would not be safe. But I will carry you across the river safely on my back, if you promise to return the favor.” Man agreed, and Crocodile bore him safely across the water When they reached the far bank, Man asked, “How can I repay you?” Crocodile replied, “I wish to see the realm of Humans, but I fear to go there alone, because it teems with your brethren. You must carry me on your back across your realm.” Man had been tricked, but a promise is a promise, so he carried Crocodile safely on his back across the entire realm of humans, a journey that lasted many years. He also swore, in his anger, that never again would Men and Crocodiles be friends, and so it has remained to this day.
