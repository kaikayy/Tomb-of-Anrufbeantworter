	- [[Kadrin]] has an existential crisis and says about that time, yes

	- [[Kadrin]] answers, no, but I also didn't try to contact it again, last time it seemed like it was behind a wall, distant
	- [[Hubris]] says someone is trying to keep it at a distant it seems
	- [[Kadrin]] asks about the name [[Hubert Brisworth]] again
		- Persuasion: 21
	- [[Hubris]] answers that the name [[Hubert Brisworth]] was his own full name before he became a weapon, there is more to it, the [[Soul Warden]] isn't the best fan of [[Hubris]] so he received a new name wit his transformation. He was given to the Monastery, whose leader was a devout follower of the [[Soul Warden]] and he was told that [[Hubris]] was a divine artifact of the [[Soul Warden]]. It was all a ruse by the [[Soul Warden]] and she tricked the three of them.
	- [[Kadrin]] understands that he was tricked and asks who [[Hubris]] even is
	- [[Hubris]] answers that he was not allowed to tell since, but things have changed now
		- He once was a respectable Paladin of [[Lathender]]
		- He wondered the lands, defeating evil and saving beautiful maidens
		- He had a disciple, Fürst [[Troy]], short-lived and he was happy to see his face caved in by [[Shadow]] seeming as [[Lathender]] always favoured [[Troy]]

			- [[Kadrin]], Insight: 11
				- Hard to read
		- He later found out that the village was plagued by a group of bandits hiding in the woods, so at night he went into the woods and killed the bandits responsible

		- The [[Hag'se Organization]] sold the knifes to the hags and were made of the same material as [[Hubris]], [[Zaranite]]
		- [[Hubert Brisworth]]'s soul was absorbed by the blades of the hags and sent to the [[Soul Warden]]
		- [[Zaranite]] has the property to send souls to the [[Soul Warden]] when they are released in the near vicinity

		- realises that he was part of the [[Soul Warden]]'s plan for a very long time
	- [[Hubris]] doubts that it's the whole plan to gather souls with [[Kadrin]]
		- The [[Soul Warden]] was more keen on nurturing the Light within [[Kadrin]], that he was some kind of key, maybe not the only one but the "most refined"
		- [[Hubris]] believes that [[Kadrin]] is special in a way that he is a Chosen One by some God other than the [[Soul Warden]]

	- [[Kadrin]] asks if he knew that they have been taking Souls away from this world the whole time
	- [[Hubris]] answers, he did, since he was turned into a sword, but he wasn't allowed to tell him and wanted to avoid more severe punishment. The [[Soul Warden]] promised to resurrect [[Hubris]] if he fulfils his goal with [[Kadrin]]
