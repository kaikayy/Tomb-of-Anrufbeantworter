	- It's Omuen Spices with a note from [[Hubert Brisworth]] saying:
		- `Dear Kadrin,`
		- `If you are reading this, my plan to restore your light has hopefully worked which also means you are in more danger than ever before. When the Soulscourge took me from you, she offered me a new chance to free me from the sword she put me in. She would give me a temporary Body and I would need to work with Herald to capture you and find the kidnapped host of the Soulscourge: an elf by the name of Eillee Lunardew. According to the Soulscourge, Acererak has been messing with them and kidnapped Eillee and is keeping her in the Tomb of the nine gods. In order for the soulsourge to have any power in our world, she needs a host body, which means if Acererak kills her, the Hud'se entire operration would crumble! Thats unfortunatly also where you come in. The Soulscourge has been searching for a new host for a while and she has set her eyes on you. Eillee's health has been decreasing fast after she was possessed. In order for a mortal body to sustain her, it need a strong divine connection like yours. When she gave you some of her power, it came with a bit of her essence, which is suppossed to over take you once your light becomes strong enough. I have a bad feeling about this tomb and i think you will need your light once you enter it. What I did puts you in danger of being overtaken by her but I know that you and your friends can overcome her!`
		- `This is all I was able to find out and I don't know what will happen to me once I go though with this, but whatever it will be, atleast I know you'll be fine. I managed to barter with the Soulscourge a bit to give me Gannin's Staff and found some spice during my time here in Omu. Its a shame I never got to taste your cooking. This is a bit embarassing to write but you were to me like the son that i may or may have.`
		- `-your Mentor Hubert Brisworth`
