We discuss if [[Kadrin]] should contact the [[Soul Warden]] and the party advises against it, [[Talsen]] says the next time she meets us it should be in person and all at once.
[[Kadrin]] asks [[Shadow]] if she knows the place he has been to meet the [[Soul Warden]]. She doesn't.
[[Talsen]] takes the blood vials off of [[Shadow]]s hands.
