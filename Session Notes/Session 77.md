Recap - [[Kadrin]]

[[Sithi Vinecutter]] and the others have started forging replacement Keys

We see the Longsword of [[Ragnis]] stuck in the stone near the forge
- [[Delwyn]] tries to lift it out with Mage Hand
	- it won't budge

We go look for survivors in the room adjacent to the forge
- we see a lot of sleeping striders, one awake looking at us angrily
- none of them have saddles or armor
- [[Kadrin]] tries to calm the awake one down
	- It puts its head back down but keeps a lookout
- [[Musharib]] tells us that this was the minecart bay

We go back to the start to explore the other areas
- [[Talsen]] wants to go into the smoke-filled room to test it out
	- it is very hard to breathe and see in there
- [[Delwyn]], Arcana: 8 - Hard to tell if the smoke is magical
- [[Musharib]] tells us that the smoke wasn't there when he left

We go the opposite way first following minecart tracks
- a lot of empty alcoves where ore once was
- we get to a bigger junction and [[Musharib]] tells us that this is the passage to the [[Wyrmheart Mine]]
- another alcove is barred with makeshift metal bars
	- we look inside and see two tied up and gagged dwarves, blood covers part of the floors
	- [[Talsen]] tries to pull the bars out, STR: 18
		- they fall out
		- together with [[Kadrin]] and [[Shadow]] the rest of the bars don't bend they just fall apart
	- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense
		- nothing
	- [[Kadrin]] and [[Musharib]] take a closer look at the dwarves
		- Medicine:  18, 12
			- [[Musharib]] tells us that he knows them, their names are [[Laz Drumthunder]] and [[Malkar Stonegrist]]
			- [[Kadrin]] notices that [[Laz Drumthunder]] is still breathing faintly, [[Malkar Stonegrist]] is dead
				- uses Lay on Hands to heal [[Laz Drumthunder]] for 1 HP
		- [[Shadow]] casts Goodberry and gives one to [[Laz Drumthunder]]
			- gives him some water as well
		- They unbind and ungag him
		- [[Shago]] carries both back to the other dwarves

We go back towards the first crossing to look at the smoke-filled room again
- [[Shadow]] jumps towards the next balcony ans starts casting Detect Magic
- [[Talsen]] and [[Kadrin]] go through the smoke, holding their breaths and eye(s) closed
