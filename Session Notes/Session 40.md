		- The Dome is damaged and branches come out of the roof, the door seems fine
	- Tries to open the door, it opens
		- `This crumbling pagoda must have been lovely once, with its wide, graceful arches inviting the breeze to blow through, and overlooking the silent pool below. But time, decay, and some bestial presence have given it a sinister air. It smells foul, and dark stains cover the floor and seep down the white steps.`

				- No Deal
	- Picks up one of the slightly dirtied feathers on the ground, the bird pecks his hand to let him drop it

We go outside the other door into the "Queen's Gardens"
- `The water in this pool is unusually clear. A dozen or more large fish, turtles, and lizards swim lazily through it, and waterbirds paddle on the surface. Their ripples obscure something on the bottom of the pool, so you can’t quite make it out, but the bottom appears to be blanketed in oddly shaped stones. Bits of shattered stone rest atop a square dais that rises from the middle of the pool — evidence of a sculpture that once stood atop it. Part of the sculpture lies in the pool, west of the dais: a large stone face staring up at the sky.`
