Recap - [[Kadrin]]

We come before [[Nangnang's Shrine]]
- [[Kadrin]]'s Illusion of [[Hugo]] lies down near the Shrine and starts to doze off, snoring loudly
- There seem to be no other entrances, the main door is covered with slime
- We go inside the shrine
- `Torches shed light over rooms filled of treasure: chests heaped with coins, polished amphorae, strings of pearls, and ornate pieces of armor. Set into the floor in front of another double door is a mosaic depicting a frog-like humanoid beating a leopard that has snakes emerging from its shoulders. Cuneiform inscriptions are woven above and below the combatants.`
- [[Kadrin]] uses Divine Sense
	- nothing

	- puts back all the gold
	- starts reading out the texts on the floor and doors
		- `Nangnang teaches us, to serve only ourselves.`
- [[Shadow]] investigates the other double doors
	- it has no keyhole or handle and is adorned with writing in old Omuen
	- picks up a single piece of gold and goes back to the door
	- the doors open
	- `In the middle of this dusty room, a stone cube rests on a pedestal carved and painted to resemble a squat, humanoid frog.`

We continue our trek toward [[Obo'laka's Shrine]]

	- The palace walls are pretty intact from this side, there are no guards posted on the walls or [[Yuan-Ti]] visible on the higher areas of the palace itself

We arrive at [[Obo'laka's Shrine]]
- `A pair of needlelike columns mark the entrance to a walled ruin. In the courtyard beyond, banyan roots envelop a squat building. The stone doors that seal the entrance are carved with images of snarling bears with long, sharp claws.`

	- [[Kadrin]] casts Light on his Sword
- We go inside weapons drawn
- `The walls of this dark corridor are covered with painted reliefs showing Omuan people hunting, harvesting fruit, planting crops, crafting weapons, feasting, fighting, weaving, and skinning animals. Eight empty torch brackets protrude from the walls under the reliefs.`
- [[Talsen]], Investigation: 19
	- The relief on the ground is not a trap
- We enter a new room

		- she dives in again and emerges with the rest of the party again
	- [[Delwyn]] and [[Kadrin]] follow
